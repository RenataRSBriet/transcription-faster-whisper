[159.00s -> 160.00s]  Second.

[193.00s -> 196.00s]  You do. Normally I do.
[196.00s -> 199.00s]  Yes, sir.
[199.00s -> 207.00s]  Motion carries agenda is approved.
[207.00s -> 209.00s]  Director's report.
[209.00s -> 210.00s]  Thank you.
[210.00s -> 211.00s]  Good morning, everybody.
[211.00s -> 213.00s]  Bob Bothwell for each hello.
[213.00s -> 221.00s]  First item on the director's report is the board membership and membership information.
[221.00s -> 227.00s]  Chrissy was going to do this, but Chrissy, you're not here, but you are online.
[227.00s -> 228.00s]  Did you want to do it?
[228.00s -> 232.00s]  Or I can cover it for you today and then we can get together and.
[232.00s -> 237.00s]  I'm not sure that I sound okay.
[238.00s -> 239.00s]  Just stay at home.
[239.00s -> 242.00s]  And don't breathe through the microphone. I don't want to get it.
[242.00s -> 244.00s]  Okay, I'll do it.
[244.00s -> 247.00s]  So good morning, everybody.
[247.00s -> 248.00s]  Bob Bothwell again.
[248.00s -> 251.00s]  And real quick.
[251.00s -> 263.00s]  The status for the board members is Ronald Ferris is in a second term and it expires February 2826 and cannot reappoint.
[263.00s -> 268.00s]  Chris Chapman also dentures second term.
[268.00s -> 271.00s]  It expires 925 of.
[271.00s -> 272.00s]  22.
[272.00s -> 276.00s]  There's a typo in there, Chrissy, I think.
[276.00s -> 279.00s]  And Chris cannot reappoint.
[279.00s -> 288.00s]  Todd Young is in a first term and it expires 314 of it expires 314 at 24 and can reappoint.
[288.00s -> 292.00s]  And I think Todd, you got that all taken care of, right?
[293.00s -> 298.00s]  I do believe that we finally got everything in. I think so.
[298.00s -> 302.00s]  If if if I didn't check a box ride or something, I.
[302.00s -> 305.00s]  I went through a whole bunch of stuff, so.
[305.00s -> 307.00s]  Okay, got to tell me if I'm missing something.
[307.00s -> 310.00s]  Kevin, our office confirmed everything's good for you Todd.
[310.00s -> 311.00s]  So we're good.
[311.00s -> 320.00s]  We missed the deadline to reappoint, but what will happen is that you'll just continue to serve and then you'll be reappointed in the next Senate session.
[320.00s -> 321.00s]  Thank you, Chris.
[321.00s -> 322.00s]  Yeah.
[322.00s -> 324.00s]  Thank you very much.
[324.00s -> 330.00s]  Grant Smith, Grant dentures is in a second term.
[330.00s -> 334.00s]  It expires September 2225 and cannot reappoint.
[334.00s -> 336.00s]  Dr. Schwant is in a first term.
[336.00s -> 342.00s]  It expires 1024 of 26 and he can reappoint.
[342.00s -> 347.00s]  Jennifer Ferguson, the public member is in a first term, which expires.
[347.00s -> 351.00s]  February 15 to 27 and Jennifer can reappoint.
[351.00s -> 355.00s]  And we have a public member vacancy.
[355.00s -> 357.00s]  So.
[357.00s -> 364.00s]  Anybody knows of anyone who's interested in being on the board, public member, or.
[364.00s -> 370.00s]  A dentureist, Denta, not a dentist. He's still good with us, but a dentureist. Let us know.
[370.00s -> 373.00s]  I'll let them know to reach out to us.
[374.00s -> 381.00s]  I do know that our association has sent out emails to all members requesting that.
[381.00s -> 385.00s]  So I don't know if Megan has heard anything back.
[385.00s -> 386.00s]  Okay.
[386.00s -> 387.00s]  Very good.
[387.00s -> 390.00s]  The point pointed them in your all's direction.
[390.00s -> 391.00s]  Very good.
[391.00s -> 396.00s]  And if Megan needs any information, you can offer up Chrissy.
[396.00s -> 399.00s]  Okay.
[399.00s -> 400.00s]  Okay.
[400.00s -> 401.00s]  This is Ron.
[401.00s -> 402.00s]  Yeah, Ron.
[402.00s -> 407.00s]  On the Chris Chapman typo, possibly there is that.
[407.00s -> 411.00s]  Is that because his term was up and he's voluntary to stay on until somebody was appointed?
[411.00s -> 415.00s]  Or is that the typo?
[415.00s -> 417.00s]  I am not sure.
[417.00s -> 418.00s]  Okay.
[418.00s -> 420.00s]  I.
[420.00s -> 421.00s]  I'm comfortable either way.
[421.00s -> 423.00s]  I was just curious if.
[423.00s -> 428.00s]  Volunteering to stay on until somebody else was appointed was an option that was there.
[428.00s -> 431.00s]  So we weren't going to run it up.
[431.00s -> 433.00s]  I think it expired.
[433.00s -> 437.00s]  Like some time ago, I don't remember now, but I'm happy to stay on so.
[437.00s -> 438.00s]  Okay.
[438.00s -> 439.00s]  Well, thank you.
[439.00s -> 441.00s]  We appreciate it, Chris.
[441.00s -> 442.00s]  Chrissy.
[442.00s -> 443.00s]  That's correct.
[443.00s -> 444.00s]  That's correct.
[444.00s -> 445.00s]  He expired in 22.
[445.00s -> 446.00s]  Oh my goodness.
[446.00s -> 447.00s]  Yep.
[447.00s -> 449.00s]  Sorry, my computer was frozen.
[449.00s -> 451.00s]  But yes, that is the typo.
[451.00s -> 453.00s]  They are serving until replaced.
[453.00s -> 455.00s]  Okay.
[455.00s -> 458.00s]  And I'll try to remember that when we meet again.
[458.00s -> 461.00s]  Because I didn't remember it last time either.
[461.00s -> 463.00s]  Alrighty, moving on.
[463.00s -> 468.00s]  Annually board members, there is some training that is required.
[468.00s -> 472.00s]  And then once per term, there is some training required.
[472.00s -> 474.00s]  So I'll just hit that real quick.
[474.00s -> 478.00s]  Overview of boards and commissions is required once per term.
[478.00s -> 481.00s]  So if you re up, you have to do it again.
[481.00s -> 484.00s]  Information security training foundations is required.
[484.00s -> 487.00s]  Providing discrimination or harassment is required annually.
[487.00s -> 490.00s]  And the overview of Oregon ethics law is optional.
[490.00s -> 495.00s]  However, I'm going to touch base on some of that here in a second.
[495.00s -> 504.00s]  And even though it's optional based on a rule change, I would recommend attending or taking that when you have a moment.
[504.00s -> 509.00s]  Speaking of that.
[510.00s -> 514.00s]  There's something, some information I want to share with the board.
[514.00s -> 516.00s]  With my report.
[516.00s -> 519.00s]  So I don't know if we've covered this previously.
[519.00s -> 523.00s]  This might be old information, but the.
[523.00s -> 534.00s]  HLO are elite system allows now for licensees to change mailing and email addresses and phone numbers online.
[534.00s -> 539.00s]  Through the HLO website and the few they're having problems with that.
[539.00s -> 547.00s]  They can let us know, but it's basically they have to sign in, create an account basically and.
[547.00s -> 554.00s]  They can log in and provide that information and keep it up to date. Nathan, go ahead.
[554.00s -> 556.00s]  Thank you bosses. This is Nathan Goldberg.
[556.00s -> 561.00s]  This is a reminder we're going to put something on the web that please do not.
[561.00s -> 568.00s]  We're going to use any symbols to like if you lived in an apartment, if you could just say a P T eight.
[568.00s -> 571.00s]  I know that seems weird, but it's a little bit of a restriction in our system.
[571.00s -> 575.00s]  So just wanted to put that out there.
[575.00s -> 582.00s]  Will it not allow them to do it or will it allow them to do it and then it just causes an issue?
[582.00s -> 588.00s]  I don't think it'll allow them to do it at all. It'll give an error message.
[588.00s -> 592.00s]  But it shouldn't only be a problem like with apartments or stuff like that.
[592.00s -> 593.00s]  But yes, that's.
[593.00s -> 596.00s]  It didn't allow them.
[596.00s -> 598.00s]  Okay. Thanks Nathan.
[598.00s -> 600.00s]  And Nathan is our.
[600.00s -> 602.00s]  IT guy.
[602.00s -> 604.00s]  Ron.
[604.00s -> 606.00s]  Yeah, this is an interesting question.
[606.00s -> 615.00s]  I know somebody has involved in a different board, but they had an issue with communication over the last few years.
[615.00s -> 622.00s]  They, they applied and paid for their license, but the money never got there.
[622.00s -> 632.00s]  So they tried to contact them in the email that they had returned or the mailing address returned undeliverable.
[632.00s -> 635.00s]  And so there was no communication for a few years.
[635.00s -> 640.00s]  And then when the person got inspected, it was a hairdressing thing.
[641.00s -> 650.00s]  Then now she's up against the rules of not notification and three years.
[650.00s -> 653.00s]  And so she asked go back to school after 50 years.
[653.00s -> 659.00s]  And so I like the idea of open communication and being able to do it online.
[659.00s -> 668.00s]  But if I paid for a license and they sent it to me and it came back undeliverable and business goes on a couple years later.
[668.00s -> 674.00s]  How was that avoidable or is that just.
[674.00s -> 681.00s]  Well, if they haven't updated their information with us, we're not going to, we're not going to be able to get a hold of them.
[681.00s -> 683.00s]  So it's incumbent on them.
[683.00s -> 688.00s]  The licensees to reach out to h love by pay for something and I don't get it within a week.
[688.00s -> 693.00s]  Unless it said off TV 8 to 12 weeks delivered.
[693.00s -> 696.00s]  If I don't get it within a week, I'm going to call and ask questions.
[696.00s -> 699.00s]  I also see the licensing manager has her hand up.
[699.00s -> 702.00s]  Maybe Tina can answer that.
[702.00s -> 703.00s]  Good morning, everybody.
[703.00s -> 705.00s]  This is Tina Russell.
[705.00s -> 718.00s]  If a license is returned to us due to bad address, we put it in a folder and we put in the note field and we mark bad address on their license.
[718.00s -> 726.00s]  It is up to the individual to they can come in over the counter and take care of any inquiries they have.
[726.00s -> 731.00s]  They can email us any day of the week and they can call us.
[731.00s -> 735.00s]  So three years later and they're expired.
[735.00s -> 744.00s]  Yeah, they have to go back to school and retake their exams and come back in and qualify just like everybody else does.
[744.00s -> 749.00s]  I mean, that makes sense. And so it's just like calling for a friend kind of thing.
[749.00s -> 756.00s]  But if the address on the check that cleared was the same as the undeliverable address.
[756.00s -> 758.00s]  That might be the issue.
[758.00s -> 763.00s]  So anyway, thanks for clarifying that it's.
[763.00s -> 766.00s]  I believe that I just need to hear it. So I said it right. Thank you.
[766.00s -> 768.00s]  Okay, you're good. All right.
[768.00s -> 775.00s]  So moving on. If you guys, if everybody's okay.
[775.00s -> 782.00s]  So you'll hear and you've already heard that the scripts have changed a little bit.
[782.00s -> 791.00s]  And so the government ethics commission and acted rules are related to public meetings law back in October.
[791.00s -> 799.00s]  And the things that changed and they just actually want to make it clear is.
[799.00s -> 803.00s]  I want to have my notes out of order.
[803.00s -> 814.00s]  If they, if we're doing public comment within a board meeting in the public's allowed to comment the presiding officer taught in this case.
[814.00s -> 819.00s]  How long can you regulate in which how long people can speak.
[819.00s -> 826.00s]  And during the presentation, the material that the individual, the public is speaking about.
[826.00s -> 833.00s]  Has to be something on the agenda or it needs to be related to this board.
[833.00s -> 837.00s]  And that has statutory authority to regulate.
[837.00s -> 840.00s]  And everybody has to be given the same amount of time.
[840.00s -> 844.00s]  I mean, it was public comment. I grabbed my phone and typically taught it.
[844.00s -> 847.00s]  It's about three minutes.
[847.00s -> 850.00s]  And we give for people to give public comment.
[850.00s -> 853.00s]  And I said a timer and give them three minutes.
[853.00s -> 858.00s]  And the will you will, will, will, will.
[858.00s -> 861.00s]  Well, HL of staff help the chair.
[861.00s -> 865.00s]  Recognize that if there's someone that so that I don't like.
[866.00s -> 869.00s]  Everyone's, you know, picture on the screen or know that.
[869.00s -> 874.00s]  I mean, as I'm reading through this, this, this, I mean, this.
[874.00s -> 880.00s]  I guess I could, I could see myself totally blowing by someone on purpose, but just on an act of a mission.
[880.00s -> 885.00s]  Like, I don't want to put a, but our board or, or HLO in a, in a position.
[885.00s -> 888.00s]  So who would that be? Is that you, Bob? Or is it?
[888.00s -> 892.00s]  It'll be, it'll be everybody. It'll be me. It could be Sammy.
[892.00s -> 895.00s]  It could be Josh who.
[895.00s -> 902.00s]  Run basically runs the computer part of the meeting is responsible for getting this online.
[902.00s -> 911.00s]  So yeah. And then if they're being disruptive, we also have the ability to mute them.
[911.00s -> 917.00s]  Okay. And you can give us a, you know, you can start saying, hey, you know, you're off topic.
[918.00s -> 921.00s]  I mean, it'll happen when it happens, right?
[921.00s -> 932.00s]  It's hard to describe that somebody on the dentures board meeting is going to talk about something other than dentures, but you never know.
[932.00s -> 938.00s]  So and then board training of pieces that you brought up.
[938.00s -> 944.00s]  So if you said it's voluntary, not mandatory, but highly recommended.
[944.00s -> 955.00s]  So do we just need to send an email that we want that added to our courses in whatever the platform is that I had a heck of a time getting on.
[955.00s -> 958.00s]  How do we, how do we add that to the, to the course list?
[958.00s -> 959.00s]  I don't think so.
[959.00s -> 960.00s]  So solve and roll those.
[960.00s -> 963.00s]  So these are hot links.
[963.00s -> 972.00s]  If you go, so if you go to this information, the board information that I'm reviewing and this is some looking at slide 10 right now.
[972.00s -> 973.00s]  Okay.
[973.00s -> 977.00s]  All the trainings are hot links. So they should take you to where you need to go.
[977.00s -> 982.00s]  And if not, let us know and we can point you in the right direction.
[982.00s -> 984.00s]  Sometimes these links will break.
[984.00s -> 987.00s]  And they're not working correctly.
[987.00s -> 992.00s]  So we'll, if you let us know, we don't always have an opportunity to take.
[992.00s -> 994.00s]  It definitely does take you to work day.
[994.00s -> 1001.00s]  I'm not going to try to get on work day during this call because of my past amazing ability to function in an online environment.
[1001.00s -> 1004.00s]  So whoever was helping me, thank you again.
[1004.00s -> 1005.00s]  Yeah.
[1005.00s -> 1006.00s]  Okay.
[1006.00s -> 1009.00s]  So yeah, we'll get you, get to what you need.
[1009.00s -> 1010.00s]  Thank you.
[1010.00s -> 1011.00s]  Not a problem.
[1011.00s -> 1015.00s]  And with regards to executive session.
[1015.00s -> 1020.00s]  The executive session, we're pretty good at what we do.
[1020.00s -> 1022.00s]  Give us, give ourselves some kudos.
[1022.00s -> 1030.00s]  We run a pretty tight ship when it comes to executive session and try to keep everybody on top.
[1030.00s -> 1033.00s]  And not straight during executive session.
[1033.00s -> 1045.00s]  And we, it says, my notes here are saying, you know, during executive session, you can't have votes, but.
[1045.00s -> 1052.00s]  While in, while in executive session, you can't have a vote, but we can come to an informal consensus before we exit out of executive session.
[1052.00s -> 1066.00s]  So for example, if we're discussing a case and, you know, someone is one of the board members is not quite sure what direction to go, not that we need to have everybody vote.
[1066.00s -> 1078.00s]  Yes, but we can come to a consensus and then we'll know if we will have a majority vote or not when we come out of executive session.
[1078.00s -> 1083.00s]  But I have yet to see that people can abstain or people can vote no.
[1083.00s -> 1093.00s]  But as long as we have a majority vote, whatever we're working on an executive session will pass when it gets into public session.
[1093.00s -> 1096.00s]  Oh, what else?
[1096.00s -> 1102.00s]  So I discussed the training requirements.
[1102.00s -> 1109.00s]  Let's see, we've discussed revising the scripts.
[1109.00s -> 1115.00s]  And what that entails going through my notes here.
[1115.00s -> 1122.00s]  So then the scary part, but like I said, we run a pretty tight ship that's not too scary.
[1122.00s -> 1146.00s]  But if a public member or someone from the public decides to file a complaint because the board has violated a public meetings law, they can file a complaint and it gets filed against all board members and all board members can be held liable.
[1146.00s -> 1167.00s]  There have been some cases in recent history, not with HLO, but with other entities, city local governments that violated public meetings law, they organ government ethics gave them not a civil penalty but had them do some extra training.
[1167.00s -> 1180.00s]  They chalked it up that way, but the point is, is they are watching it. And so we want to ensure that we abide by government ethics.
[1180.00s -> 1191.00s]  And then the complaints and grievances piece of this is we HLO had to put on each board website and on our website.
[1191.00s -> 1200.00s]  And Avenue for filed to for folks to file public meeting complaints or grievances.
[1200.00s -> 1207.00s]  And if board members are questioned on something like that, they should just direct them to HLO.
[1207.00s -> 1212.00s]  And we'll get them where they need to be.
[1212.00s -> 1220.00s]  The complaints must be filed with HLO prior to going to government ethics commission.
[1220.00s -> 1231.00s]  And they must be filed within 30 days of the alleged violation filed with HLO and then HLO needs to respond within 10 days.
[1231.00s -> 1249.00s]  So it says, like I said, it is posted on our website. And then there's a frequently asked questions piece that will be in this later that I'm reading from basically I know Todd, you probably already got it and do we have a vice chair.
[1249.00s -> 1258.00s]  Not yet. No, we don't. So the rest of the board members will get this information after the meeting.
[1259.00s -> 1266.00s]  And again, if you know somebody who wants to be on the board, let them know. Please.
[1266.00s -> 1276.00s]  And in your materials that you received and that are on our website, it discusses how to apply for membership.
[1276.00s -> 1284.00s]  And again, Chrissy's number is all over the place. So if somebody asks you, they can reach out to her.
[1285.00s -> 1289.00s]  Thank you.
[1289.00s -> 1297.00s]  We got not a problem. Sorry, I got a little long winded on that. I just want to make sure everybody's well aware of our eyes and cross our teeth.
[1297.00s -> 1300.00s]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1300.00s -> 1305.00s]  So moving on to some statistics real quick.
[1305.00s -> 1313.00s]  No license have been issued in quarter four, but we've had one license issued in quarter three.
[1313.00s -> 1320.00s]  So fiscal year 2025 licenses renewed. It just makes me happy.
[1320.00s -> 1332.00s]  As a clam with seeing that most everybody, all the licensees for this program are renewing online. There's a couple outliers out there, but it's getting better and better.
[1333.00s -> 1354.00s]  We have two folks that identify as male between 18 and 25 and one, two identifying as female between 82 and 89 and then arrange between those age groups.
[1354.00s -> 1382.00s]  So it appears to be a generally a male, I dominated profession licensing trends were relatively static at the 112, 114 average and with a couple of the new denturists and temporary licenses.
[1385.00s -> 1387.00s]  Okay.
[1387.00s -> 1394.00s]  I don't know how in depth the board needs me to go into the testing statistics.
[1394.00s -> 1396.00s]  What?
[1396.00s -> 1399.00s]  Now this is Ron.
[1399.00s -> 1408.00s]  We were at the conversation before I thought that the written was going to be a passer fail. I see that the written and the practical or both the passer fail.
[1408.00s -> 1412.00s]  Maybe I missed that at the beginning.
[1412.00s -> 1415.00s]  What are you asking, Ron?
[1415.00s -> 1423.00s]  Well, there was it was requested that the written be passer fail.
[1423.00s -> 1428.00s]  Just for convenience with the health of vision and reporting.
[1428.00s -> 1433.00s]  Now I see that the practical is also pass and fail.
[1433.00s -> 1438.00s]  I see that you take certain parts of the practical and if you were weak, you could redo it.
[1438.00s -> 1441.00s]  Now it's just all pass the fail.
[1441.00s -> 1451.00s]  Yeah, Tina can speak, speak more to this and then if you have questions after that, let's go ahead, Tina.
[1451.00s -> 1463.00s]  So the written exam can't be a passer fail because if they fail certain sections of it, they have to go back and take it to show hours.
[1463.00s -> 1465.00s]  Yeah.
[1465.00s -> 1468.00s]  And then work.
[1468.00s -> 1476.00s]  Oh, no, it's the practical sorry, the practical you have to go back and take it to showers.
[1476.00s -> 1499.00s]  Yes, so just just just for the point of information, Ron, what what UTS reports to the regulatory body is we report a percentage because it's the same exam that's given for for candidates that are attempting to license in Montana or Idaho or Maine or Arizona.
[1499.00s -> 1509.00s]  So different and depending on what state you're in, you may have a minimum passing rate of 65 or 80%.
[1509.00s -> 1526.00s]  So we don't we don't recommend we just give a percentage this but this is recognized as 70% is the state of Oregon's minimum standard for the written examination and practical actually so well.
[1526.00s -> 1528.00s]  Does that make sense?
[1528.00s -> 1538.00s]  Yeah, it does what the what the current standards for education it yeah, it makes sense. Thank you.
[1538.00s -> 1543.00s]  Okay, anything else on the tests?
[1543.00s -> 1555.00s]  If not, I will jump on over to the financial and the board is just about right where we need where we need you as far as balance.
[1555.00s -> 1563.00s]  It would take a good case and it could put a dent in it, but we had a beginning cash balance of 249 850.
[1563.00s -> 1583.00s]  Yes, 249 850 revenues of 17,660 expenditures of 7,840 net operations of 9,820 if any cash balance of 259,670.
[1583.00s -> 1603.00s]  And these are for fiscal year, which and all actually all the numbers that I talked about for the previous slides are all fiscal years so that is from July 1 of any particular year till June 30 of the following year.
[1603.00s -> 1619.00s]  Okay, so trampuses on vacation and I will take care of the regulatory report, I'm not going to go into a whole lot of detail because everybody on the board has been here for a minute has heard the speech a few times.
[1619.00s -> 1643.00s]  So for 2025 we've had or we have eight complaints open five with regarding the dental and oral pathology endorsements and three unlicensed entered text.
[1643.00s -> 1651.00s]  So if we close three and add in three is basically where we're at, is that accurate Bob is looks looks like it.
[1651.00s -> 1654.00s]  Yeah, we're in that neighborhood.
[1654.00s -> 1664.00s]  So yeah, I mean they come in and Michael's on the line here. I don't know if he has a few wants to share you typically the investigator that handles all the cases.
[1664.00s -> 1673.00s]  But we get to him quickly and this quickly is possible and get him closed out.
[1673.00s -> 1678.00s]  All right, how do these complaints get resolved?
[1678.00s -> 1683.00s]  What's the process for resolving the complaints?
[1683.00s -> 1704.00s]  So the complaints come in and trampus reviews them and decides whether or not it actually belongs to this board or another board because we get a lot of those will get complaints against dentists that come in and then we just refer them out or call the complainant and have them contact the board of dentistry.
[1704.00s -> 1729.00s]  The trampus decides that it's a complaint with enough merit, we'll assign it out and Michael will just go through the process he'll review it, collect whatever documentation records that he needs to get interview witnesses and the respondent and if there is no practice violations, then we'll close it.
[1729.00s -> 1741.00s]  If there is a practice violation, I don't think you have any civil penalties in rule. I apologize has been so long since I've done the regulatory piece, I don't recall.
[1741.00s -> 1758.00s]  But anyway, we may bring it to the board and have the board helps decide how bad the violation is and what sort of discipline will need to be issued to the respondents.
[1758.00s -> 1776.00s]  It can be anything from training to civil penalty, to revocation suspension or any mixed thereof and we send out and that's called a notice of intent and then after 30 days will send out a final order.
[1776.00s -> 1790.00s]  And we do post the discipline on our website, it'll be under your board and it'll be disciplinary actions and anybody can go in there and see if they know an individual's name and look it up.
[1790.00s -> 1819.00s]  So to clarify that, Bruce, I believe and Michael can confirm this, but we can confirm this is that during that information gathering process where records are gathered and that he determines whether it's a service based complaint or practice standards violation, if it's a practice standards violation, you'll generally bring in a subject matter expert to ensure us to review the chart notes, interview notes.
[1819.00s -> 1834.00s]  And make a recommendation back to him based on that, correct me if I'm wrong, Michael, is that is that still the way that it back when I was I think that's way it's been fraternity, but is that right?
[1834.00s -> 1858.00s]  Yes, that's correct. So after investigations, collecting for information, get information, anything's violation to standards, probably standard practice of unprecedented, I will send out information to SME for him or her to reveal with his recommendation.
[1858.00s -> 1877.00s]  Then I bring to the managers, that's Drampa Sharks, and he would decide it is this violation or not, if it's not sure and we bring to the boards, if we have a violation standard.
[1877.00s -> 1882.00s]  Thank you, Michael, Ron, did you have a question?
[1882.00s -> 1896.00s]  No, just on that same thought, the pool of investigators, we were really weak on that a while back and we send out a lot of information. So we got a pretty good pool or group that we can draw from.
[1896.00s -> 1915.00s]  Well, we have five currently five investigators and we're bringing one more on to fill Travis's spot. And by the way, Travis at your last meeting was an interim regulatory manager. Now he's the permanent regulatory manager.
[1915.00s -> 1944.00s]  So and to kind of add to this whole topic, Dr is the investigators are professional investigators. They're not professionals in any of the professions. So we use subject matter experts or the board, whenever we have questions or uncertainties to do the job and make sure it's fair and equitable.
[1945.00s -> 1949.00s]  Okay. Any other questions?
[1949.00s -> 1953.00s]  How many trees do we have for DT? Do you know?
[1953.00s -> 1958.00s]  I don't know off top of my head. Maybe Michael knows.
[1958.00s -> 1960.00s]  How many what? I'm sorry.
[1960.00s -> 1965.00s]  Subject matter experts for DT.
[1965.00s -> 1972.00s]  I assume that currently we, we may not have any.
[1972.00s -> 1974.00s]  I think that's what Ron was asking about.
[1974.00s -> 1977.00s]  Yes, it was. Thank you.
[1977.00s -> 1994.00s]  We may have the last one is we didn't have a contract signed by previous ones. So Trump was to say that he will try to get in touch with the previous one to get the contracted size.
[1994.00s -> 1998.00s]  Okay. So it's like the.
[1998.00s -> 2000.00s]  Sorry. Go ahead.
[2000.00s -> 2006.00s]  Sounds like the investigators are independent contractors that work with multiple entities. Is that correct?
[2006.00s -> 2009.00s]  The subject matter experts are independent contractors.
[2009.00s -> 2011.00s]  Okay. Sorry. I meant.
[2011.00s -> 2015.00s]  Here's the investigators are independent contractors also are.
[2015.00s -> 2017.00s]  No, they're employees.
[2017.00s -> 2021.00s]  There's state employees, but they work with various boards.
[2021.00s -> 2029.00s]  Yeah, one one investigator could investigate two or three different boards.
[2029.00s -> 2035.00s]  At a time. So we get about, we get over 200 cases a year.
[2035.00s -> 2042.00s]  That would get assigned out and if you do and go ahead and do the math divided by five or six.
[2042.00s -> 2050.00s]  That's a lot. So we're shifting and weaving and bobbing with priorities all day long.
[2050.00s -> 2057.00s]  So you'll know some of them just seem to take months to get done. Ron.
[2057.00s -> 2060.00s]  Yeah, that's that was my difficulty in understanding it.
[2060.00s -> 2064.00s]  Back in the day, an investigator was an investigator and they wore the whole hat.
[2064.00s -> 2070.00s]  And now it being divided into an investigator and a subject matter experts.
[2070.00s -> 2080.00s]  I can see how there's two categories. So, but so we're still weak on the subject matter character character. Sorry subject matter expert.
[2080.00s -> 2084.00s]  Yeah, and that that is an entire contract process.
[2084.00s -> 2086.00s]  We used to.
[2086.00s -> 2097.00s]  When I started it back in 2012 and prior, we used to make an agreement on a napkin over coffee or lunch and then we would be able to pay them but.
[2097.00s -> 2125.00s]  Yeah, so if anybody knows any subject matter experts, have them reach out to us as well.
[2125.00s -> 2130.00s]  It could be Chrissy. She can get get them in touch with Travis.
[2130.00s -> 2134.00s]  Travis, okay, that's a familiar name. Thank you.
[2134.00s -> 2142.00s]  Yeah, that explains why I was wondering how you could employ five full-time investigators for 7800 a year.
[2142.00s -> 2145.00s]  Yeah.
[2145.00s -> 2148.00s]  Got it.
[2148.00s -> 2154.00s]  Yeah, and so I see you time back on the finance.
[2154.00s -> 2158.00s]  Yeah, and that, but that also includes.
[2158.00s -> 2176.00s]  It's a very for this board. It's a relatively small percentage. Every board pays a percentage to OHA for rent, salaries, water, heat, what have you.
[2176.00s -> 2189.00s]  You're yours. They used to years ago have the percentage on here and for whatever reason where we get this report and from Portland, they decided that it was not that important anymore.
[2189.00s -> 2195.00s]  So I've been trying to get it back but they're resistant. I will prevail though, just to let you know.
[2195.00s -> 2198.00s]  Okay.
[2198.00s -> 2204.00s]  Legislation, Sammy, you still with us or did you jump on to another meeting? I know you had one coming up.
[2204.00s -> 2217.00s]  No, I'm still here. I don't have much to report the dental lab bill is back and it appears is going to go through.
[2217.00s -> 2225.00s]  There is the exemption for anybody of license under the dentures statute. So don't worry about that.
[2225.00s -> 2235.00s]  And there's also Senate bill 800, which Bob can explain this one better. It's a basically, it's a tax law that would.
[2236.00s -> 2264.00s]  Could if a department of revenue as an IRS sees that a certain profession doesn't have what is it 95% of their taxes paid in full, then they can basically audit the entire profession and require each license holder to submit to their licensing entity, a certificate of what do you call it compliance compliance that they are up to date on their taxes.
[2264.00s -> 2274.00s]  And that can go on for a long time. Yeah. They can audit the entire role of life and status or dentist, whatever license profession it is.
[2274.00s -> 2277.00s]  Yes, everybody.
[2277.00s -> 2282.00s]  I'm determined that 95% is I got to go read that. Okay.
[2282.00s -> 2284.00s]  Great question. Never mind.
[2284.00s -> 2287.00s]  We've had meetings and we've had the same question.
[2287.00s -> 2291.00s]  There's a link in your materials to it on page 28.
[2291.00s -> 2294.00s]  Yeah, definitely read that one.
[2294.00s -> 2297.00s]  And it has had a hearing. I don't has a had a work session.
[2297.00s -> 2299.00s]  I don't recall.
[2299.00s -> 2303.00s]  Have other boards been notified if you wouldn't know. I mean, yes. Okay.
[2303.00s -> 2307.00s]  All the all the HLO boards have been notified of this.
[2307.00s -> 2310.00s]  But. Okay.
[2311.00s -> 2317.00s]  And at least the OHA ones like the people that do health facilities, like hospitals, they know about it.
[2317.00s -> 2323.00s]  But I'm assuming that medical and all of them know about it, but I don't know for sure.
[2323.00s -> 2324.00s]  Okay.
[2324.00s -> 2327.00s]  But my guess is that they do.
[2327.00s -> 2330.00s]  Yeah, and your expression Todd was the same one I had when I read it.
[2330.00s -> 2332.00s]  Everybody.
[2332.00s -> 2336.00s]  And then we had to meet and we had a separate meeting with them.
[2336.00s -> 2339.00s]  Yeah.
[2339.00s -> 2346.00s]  And they made it absolutely clear that it is the entire profession.
[2346.00s -> 2348.00s]  But they said it shouldn't.
[2348.00s -> 2350.00s]  There shouldn't be any.
[2350.00s -> 2355.00s]  Back logs or anything like that. It's very fluid.
[2355.00s -> 2358.00s]  And so I was polite.
[2358.00s -> 2361.00s]  Well, that would be fluid until it's not.
[2361.00s -> 2363.00s]  So you have to provide.
[2363.00s -> 2369.00s]  Yeah.
[2369.00s -> 2374.00s]  And you have to log into their website portal or whatever that means.
[2374.00s -> 2378.00s]  And you'll have to provide us.
[2378.00s -> 2382.00s]  At least at HLO, the licensing folks.
[2382.00s -> 2386.00s]  Evidence of compliance.
[2386.00s -> 2388.00s]  And that's if you're being.
[2388.00s -> 2394.00s]  That's if the profession will be available to the public records.
[2394.00s -> 2397.00s]  The compliance piece. Yes.
[2397.00s -> 2400.00s]  The probably whatever part of.
[2400.00s -> 2403.00s]  Well, I'm not going to say that possibly.
[2403.00s -> 2408.00s]  Not probably possibly because there's information you provide is in licensing that we do.
[2408.00s -> 2410.00s]  That is exempt from public disclosure. Right.
[2410.00s -> 2413.00s]  So I don't know where that's going to land.
[2413.00s -> 2418.00s]  Because we.
[2418.00s -> 2420.00s]  We don't know.
[2420.00s -> 2423.00s]  But we'll have it figured out before it gets implemented.
[2423.00s -> 2424.00s]  But yeah.
[2424.00s -> 2428.00s]  I think the Department of revenue is aware that.
[2428.00s -> 2430.00s]  Folks are not like.
[2430.00s -> 2431.00s]  Super happy about this.
[2431.00s -> 2433.00s]  And we're very concerned about it.
[2433.00s -> 2437.00s]  Any potential backlog or causation for.
[2437.00s -> 2438.00s]  Licenses to renew late.
[2438.00s -> 2440.00s]  Because their website is down.
[2440.00s -> 2443.00s]  And they can't get a certificate.
[2443.00s -> 2445.00s]  But anyway.
[2445.00s -> 2448.00s]  I don't want to be labor that any more.
[2448.00s -> 2449.00s]  Thank you.
[2449.00s -> 2451.00s]  Thanks for bringing those to us.
[2451.00s -> 2452.00s]  Appreciate it.
[2452.00s -> 2453.00s]  Absolutely.
[2453.00s -> 2454.00s]  That's all I got.
[2454.00s -> 2456.00s]  We do it every year.
[2456.00s -> 2457.00s]  So.
[2457.00s -> 2458.00s]  Um.
[2458.00s -> 2463.00s]  Chair, do you have a script for public and interested parties feedback?
[2463.00s -> 2464.00s]  Oh, yeah.
[2464.00s -> 2465.00s]  I've got to get to that.
[2465.00s -> 2466.00s]  Give me just a quick second.
[2466.00s -> 2467.00s]  Where did that go?
[2467.00s -> 2470.00s]  Um.
[2470.00s -> 2472.00s]  All right.
[2472.00s -> 2475.00s]  At this time, the Board of Debtions Technology will hear
[2475.00s -> 2477.00s]  a public and interested parties feedback.
[2477.00s -> 2480.00s]  Public comment is limited matters listed in a meeting agenda or
[2480.00s -> 2482.00s]  topics relevant to what this board of statutory authority to
[2482.00s -> 2483.00s]  regulate.
[2483.00s -> 2485.00s]  Comments will be limited to three minutes.
[2485.00s -> 2487.00s]  We'll not be allowed if they're disrupted to the board's
[2487.00s -> 2488.00s]  conduct of its business.
[2488.00s -> 2490.00s]  If you're called on to comment,
[2490.00s -> 2494.00s]  HLO staff will request the public member to unmute themselves.
[2494.00s -> 2497.00s]  The chairperson in HLO will reserve the right to end a
[2497.00s -> 2500.00s]  person's comment early and have HLO staff mute the public
[2500.00s -> 2501.00s]  member.
[2501.00s -> 2504.00s]  If the comment does not pertain to matters listed on the
[2504.00s -> 2506.00s]  meeting agenda or topics relevant to what this board has
[2506.00s -> 2508.00s]  statutory authority to regulate.
[2508.00s -> 2511.00s]  Are there any members of the public who wish to comment?
[2511.00s -> 2514.00s]  If so, please raise your hand or use the MS teams raise hand
[2514.00s -> 2517.00s]  feature and wait to be acknowledged.
[2517.00s -> 2527.00s]  Chair, I only see board members and staff.
[2527.00s -> 2528.00s]  So, okay.
[2528.00s -> 2535.00s]  Don't have any public or party feedback.
[2535.00s -> 2536.00s]  Okay.
[2536.00s -> 2541.00s]  Next item on the agenda chair and board members is the board
[2541.00s -> 2542.00s]  business.
[2543.00s -> 2548.00s]  There are things you all need HLO to do between now and
[2548.00s -> 2549.00s]  our next meeting.
[2549.00s -> 2554.00s]  I have some thoughts that I'd like to talk about, but I didn't
[2554.00s -> 2556.00s]  know when the right time to do it is.
[2556.00s -> 2557.00s]  This is the right time.
[2557.00s -> 2558.00s]  Now's the right time.
[2558.00s -> 2559.00s]  You bet, doctor.
[2559.00s -> 2560.00s]  Cool.
[2560.00s -> 2561.00s]  Yeah.
[2561.00s -> 2566.00s]  I kind of wanted to dive in on a bigger issue.
[2566.00s -> 2570.00s]  Really the issue or the overall reason why I wanted to be on
[2570.00s -> 2576.00s]  this board is mainly because I'm seeing a title shift in
[2576.00s -> 2577.00s]  technology.
[2577.00s -> 2582.00s]  And I'm seeing that technology already having a tremendous
[2582.00s -> 2587.00s]  impact on the providing of service, particularly when it comes
[2587.00s -> 2588.00s]  to manufacturing dentures.
[2588.00s -> 2593.00s]  And I'm talking specifically here about the whole digital
[2593.00s -> 2597.00s]  idea of scanning and a digital workflow.
[2597.00s -> 2602.00s]  And the types of dentures that can be made and the methods of
[2602.00s -> 2603.00s]  making them.
[2603.00s -> 2608.00s]  And so I've been doing just in the last couple of weeks.
[2608.00s -> 2612.00s]  I've attended a couple of conferences and learned a lot about
[2612.00s -> 2613.00s]  what is happening.
[2613.00s -> 2616.00s]  And it's happening very fast.
[2616.00s -> 2620.00s]  I had a conversation this week also with a gentleman who is
[2620.00s -> 2626.00s]  a dentureist here in Oregon who is 100%.
[2626.00s -> 2627.00s]  Digital.
[2627.00s -> 2629.00s]  And I found that very interesting.
[2629.00s -> 2634.00s]  The workflow that he uses is a different than the workflow
[2634.00s -> 2641.00s]  that I would see in a that would pan out maybe in mass.
[2641.00s -> 2646.00s]  I don't know if he I've told you folks what I do or what my
[2646.00s -> 2652.00s]  position is, but I'm a I have an office here in Eugene with
[2652.00s -> 2655.00s]  affordable dentures and implants.
[2655.00s -> 2658.00s]  And so I walk people all the way through the process.
[2658.00s -> 2659.00s]  They come in with teeth.
[2659.00s -> 2661.00s]  They want their teeth out.
[2661.00s -> 2662.00s]  I take out their teeth.
[2662.00s -> 2663.00s]  I do the audio.
[2663.00s -> 2665.00s]  I do the bone grafting.
[2665.00s -> 2666.00s]  We make an immediate denture.
[2666.00s -> 2668.00s]  We make a final denture down the road.
[2668.00s -> 2669.00s]  We also place implants.
[2669.00s -> 2670.00s]  It's appropriate.
[2670.00s -> 2675.00s]  So the whole thing is fascinating to me because there's a lot
[2675.00s -> 2678.00s]  of people in Oregon that need this.
[2678.00s -> 2682.00s]  And I'm kind of surprised there's so many people that are
[2682.00s -> 2683.00s]  interested.
[2683.00s -> 2687.00s]  I don't know that many people that do this the way that I do it.
[2687.00s -> 2691.00s]  I know there are dentures maybe who have oral surgeons that
[2691.00s -> 2692.00s]  come into their practice.
[2692.00s -> 2696.00s]  I'm not sure exactly how that relationship works out.
[2696.00s -> 2702.00s]  But the piece of it that I find really, really fascinating is
[2702.00s -> 2705.00s]  the impact of technology.
[2705.00s -> 2709.00s]  And how that will affect our ability to deliver the service.
[2709.00s -> 2714.00s]  So right now we have a traditional dental lab.
[2714.00s -> 2717.00s]  And so we make all of our dentures with a four step,
[2717.00s -> 2721.00s]  well, it finals with a four step process.
[2721.00s -> 2725.00s]  Same one that we learned in dental school.
[2725.00s -> 2729.00s]  That is just it's changing just so
[2729.00s -> 2732.00s]  incredibly dramatically.
[2732.00s -> 2739.00s]  And yet I don't see the need for a traditional dental
[2739.00s -> 2746.00s]  technician who does a wax up with a person who interfaces
[2746.00s -> 2751.00s]  directly with the patient as a licensed individual.
[2751.00s -> 2753.00s]  I don't see that really going away.
[2753.00s -> 2758.00s]  But I see it being offloaded currently.
[2758.00s -> 2763.00s]  And that's those those are all questions I want to explore.
[2763.00s -> 2765.00s]  It's a big topic.
[2765.00s -> 2766.00s]  I get it.
[2766.00s -> 2771.00s]  One of the things that I talked with Josh about earlier was that I
[2771.00s -> 2776.00s]  would I want to make contact with some of the other people on.
[2776.00s -> 2780.00s]  In this group, particularly, you know, Todd, I'd love to chat
[2780.00s -> 2781.00s]  with you.
[2781.00s -> 2782.00s]  Yeah.
[2782.00s -> 2783.00s]  I hope.
[2783.00s -> 2785.00s]  The criteria that's in the show.
[2785.00s -> 2787.00s]  I've been with you about it.
[2787.00s -> 2792.00s]  And Dr, I'm we still do the same exact process that you do.
[2792.00s -> 2796.00s]  I know people that are partially digital, fully digital.
[2796.00s -> 2800.00s]  I've got some problems with some of the materials that are being put
[2800.00s -> 2803.00s]  in people's mouths that you can't repair.
[2803.00s -> 2804.00s]  You can't reline.
[2804.00s -> 2805.00s]  You can't temper him.
[2805.00s -> 2809.00s]  I mean it's they're building their using them on Medicare patients
[2809.00s -> 2811.00s]  that don't even know what they're getting.
[2811.00s -> 2812.00s]  So I'm with you.
[2812.00s -> 2818.00s]  I think that this one even from an education standpoint and a testing
[2818.00s -> 2819.00s]  standpoint.
[2819.00s -> 2822.00s]  You know, I mean, five, seven years down the road.
[2822.00s -> 2825.00s]  I don't know how many people are going to know how to set teeth and wax.
[2825.00s -> 2828.00s]  We're going to be teaching you at the at the college.
[2828.00s -> 2833.00s]  But as this, as you pointed out, the technology is like.
[2833.00s -> 2836.00s]  It's 10 freight trains, not one coming down.
[2836.00s -> 2838.00s]  Yeah, different tracks.
[2838.00s -> 2843.00s]  So yes, yeah, I totally agree and you know, 70 miles an hour
[2843.00s -> 2845.00s]  and they're only, you know, maybe 10 miles away.
[2845.00s -> 2847.00s]  It's going to hit pretty quick.
[2847.00s -> 2850.00s]  And so I think I would like to get ahead of that.
[2850.00s -> 2856.00s]  I really don't want to be, you know, just being in this space
[2856.00s -> 2861.00s]  and doing this for these people is pretty cool.
[2861.00s -> 2867.00s]  And I hate to see it get fragmented or disrupted or chaos.
[2867.00s -> 2870.00s]  And I can just, I can totally see that going down.
[2870.00s -> 2872.00s]  So anyways, that's why I joined this board.
[2872.00s -> 2876.00s]  Well, and even even to that and Ron will get your question just a second.
[2876.00s -> 2881.00s]  Even at that point, the materials, like I used to be very anti.
[2881.00s -> 2882.00s]  I mean, you've heard me.
[2882.00s -> 2886.00s]  I'm somewhat anti regulatory kudos to HLO.
[2886.00s -> 2891.00s]  But I'm talking about just oppressive or overly oppressive regulation.
[2891.00s -> 2896.00s]  But at some point, you know, the materials, the stuff that's being shipped.
[2896.00s -> 2901.00s]  You know, shipped in to the US from various countries, you know,
[2901.00s -> 2905.00s]  that may not have the same requirements that we have with an FDA
[2905.00s -> 2908.00s]  that's overseeing these materials that are going to be worn for,
[2908.00s -> 2911.00s]  whether it's short, men or long term periods.
[2911.00s -> 2915.00s]  It's a, it's a concern that I share with you.
[2915.00s -> 2919.00s]  And I think whether it's a subcommittee that we form or we just go have lunch.
[2919.00s -> 2923.00s]  And I mean, we've got to be careful forming a quorum.
[2923.00s -> 2926.00s]  I think we get too many people in one, one area.
[2926.00s -> 2931.00s]  But if we have a committee formed, then that's not an issue.
[2931.00s -> 2933.00s]  Is it Bob or Sammy?
[2933.00s -> 2935.00s]  What would the committee be doing?
[2935.00s -> 2936.00s]  I guess is the question.
[2936.00s -> 2941.00s]  While researching emerging technology that's going to affect the protection of public,
[2941.00s -> 2943.00s]  which is our charge, right?
[2943.00s -> 2944.00s]  I mean,
[2944.00s -> 2946.00s]  So what exactly?
[2946.00s -> 2948.00s]  I guess I don't, I don't know.
[2948.00s -> 2949.00s]  Is it law changes?
[2949.00s -> 2950.00s]  Is it rule changes?
[2950.00s -> 2951.00s]  Like where?
[2951.00s -> 2953.00s]  Do we really deserve it?
[2953.00s -> 2954.00s]  In your law.
[2954.00s -> 2958.00s]  Like, and I would very much, very much say.
[2958.00s -> 2966.00s]  Meeting together and discussing anything that we board business is not the greatest of ideas,
[2966.00s -> 2972.00s]  especially with the new public meetings law and that the Oregon government ethics commission is like watching everybody.
[2972.00s -> 2978.00s]  And if you're doing any type of deliberation, I mean, even the scent of it.
[2978.00s -> 2981.00s]  The email or text messaging, they are on top of it.
[2981.00s -> 2984.00s]  So that's what I would say.
[2984.00s -> 2989.00s]  And I guess I would need to, as the policy person, just need to know.
[2989.00s -> 2991.00s]  Is there law changes any made?
[2991.00s -> 2992.00s]  Are there rule changes that any made?
[2992.00s -> 2994.00s]  Are they just if accused any made?
[2994.00s -> 2998.00s]  Like, where is our destination going?
[2998.00s -> 2999.00s]  I have a question.
[2999.00s -> 3000.00s]  This is Grant Smith.
[3000.00s -> 3001.00s]  Okay.
[3001.00s -> 3007.00s]  Okay.
[3007.00s -> 3008.00s]  Can we take Ron and then grant with your question?
[3008.00s -> 3009.00s]  Yeah.
[3009.00s -> 3010.00s]  Thank you.
[3010.00s -> 3011.00s]  This is Ron.
[3011.00s -> 3012.00s]  Yeah.
[3012.00s -> 3014.00s]  With respect to the digital.
[3014.00s -> 3016.00s]  I'm still fully analog.
[3016.00s -> 3018.00s]  Done it that way.
[3018.00s -> 3020.00s]  The digital is.
[3020.00s -> 3022.00s]  Todd said it.
[3022.00s -> 3030.00s]  Well, it's the materials that are questionable, but the advertising out there in the marketing and the dentist concept.
[3030.00s -> 3033.00s]  The laboratory's nation wide.
[3033.00s -> 3036.00s]  Or saying, hey, you got a scanner in there.
[3036.00s -> 3037.00s]  You're doing.
[3037.00s -> 3040.00s]  Fix and you're doing cats in your office.
[3040.00s -> 3042.00s]  Let's do the dentures the same way.
[3042.00s -> 3044.00s]  Just scan them out send us that information.
[3044.00s -> 3053.00s]  And we'll make you a base plate and they're making the dentures, which is bringing a lot of the general practitioners back into the removable.
[3053.00s -> 3056.00s]  Because they don't have to do any hands on.
[3056.00s -> 3058.00s]  You can do it in one appointment.
[3058.00s -> 3061.00s]  And the material scare me the most.
[3061.00s -> 3066.00s]  Gathering the information, a sole dinosaur say that's.
[3066.00s -> 3070.00s]  Mechanically impossible, but we do it any way every day.
[3070.00s -> 3075.00s]  So I understand your concern about it moving too fast.
[3075.00s -> 3076.00s]  Let them.
[3076.00s -> 3077.00s]  The digitals.
[3077.00s -> 3078.00s]  I've seen.
[3078.00s -> 3079.00s]  I've seen really nice ones.
[3079.00s -> 3083.00s]  And I've seen some that just I bring back to the lab and show my interns.
[3083.00s -> 3084.00s]  I look at my goal.
[3084.00s -> 3085.00s]  You look at this.
[3085.00s -> 3087.00s]  Where do you think this came from?
[3087.00s -> 3088.00s]  And so.
[3088.00s -> 3089.00s]  It's.
[3089.00s -> 3091.00s]  It's patient education also.
[3091.00s -> 3095.00s]  They come into my office and say, well, they say they only do a digital.
[3095.00s -> 3097.00s]  And they don't want that.
[3097.00s -> 3098.00s]  And so.
[3098.00s -> 3101.00s]  I'd like to be in the meeting to find out how do we.
[3101.00s -> 3106.00s]  Let the public be aware of the options of.
[3106.00s -> 3107.00s]  Fast doesn't last.
[3107.00s -> 3108.00s]  OK.
[3108.00s -> 3109.00s]  Great.
[3109.00s -> 3110.00s]  Thank you.
[3110.00s -> 3112.00s]  Thank you for bringing it up.
[3113.00s -> 3114.00s]  My.
[3114.00s -> 3115.00s]  My.
[3115.00s -> 3120.00s]  My spot is that this would probably be a.
[3120.00s -> 3132.00s]  An association issue that maybe committees would be formed with respect to the associations that could look into things that, you know.
[3132.00s -> 3134.00s]  Like.
[3135.00s -> 3142.00s]  Densures that are manufactured and mailed into the state or other things that are happening.
[3142.00s -> 3148.00s]  It seems to me that we could avoid some trouble if we were to approach this with our association.
[3148.00s -> 3150.00s]  It's going to make recommendations to work.
[3150.00s -> 3151.00s]  Grant.
[3151.00s -> 3152.00s]  This is Ron.
[3152.00s -> 3159.00s]  As you well know, 90% of the association education, continuing education is digital.
[3159.00s -> 3160.00s]  And that's.
[3161.00s -> 3162.00s]  That being true.
[3162.00s -> 3163.00s]  That being true.
[3163.00s -> 3169.00s]  I think that really to look at, you know, I think that just a committee on the association is really where to.
[3169.00s -> 3172.00s]  We would probably approach this.
[3172.00s -> 3173.00s]  Okay.
[3173.00s -> 3174.00s]  Thank you, Grant.
[3174.00s -> 3175.00s]  Go ahead.
[3175.00s -> 3176.00s]  Thank you.
[3176.00s -> 3177.00s]  Bob.
[3177.00s -> 3178.00s]  And then doctor.
[3178.00s -> 3179.00s]  Doctors want.
[3179.00s -> 3180.00s]  Yeah. Go ahead, Bob.
[3180.00s -> 3181.00s]  So I'm glad to hear.
[3181.00s -> 3182.00s]  I'm grant.
[3182.00s -> 3184.00s]  Say that maybe it's an association issue.
[3184.00s -> 3186.00s]  That might be a place to start.
[3186.00s -> 3189.00s]  I'm with the association where.
[3189.00s -> 3194.00s]  Todd can have the conversation.
[3194.00s -> 3201.00s]  And I wouldn't highly recommend maybe Bruce attending, but maybe the dental association and then maybe.
[3201.00s -> 3205.00s]  Things seem to get put together to.
[3205.00s -> 3209.00s]  Help you figure this out on both sides, dental and dentures and.
[3209.00s -> 3210.00s]  I just had a question.
[3210.00s -> 3212.00s]  It's personal.
[3213.00s -> 3220.00s]  When you said when you're talking about technology, are we talking about like 3D printers, that type of technology.
[3220.00s -> 3231.00s]  Partly, but you're also talking about about mills and and the pucks that are being milled and the composition of those pucks where they come from that the actual source materials and that.
[3231.00s -> 3240.00s]  And so my my concern with with to your point, Grant, is with the records that this.
[3240.00s -> 3250.00s]  This oversight on open meetings and public public meetings in that is that if we don't do it in in an environment where we've got people that know.
[3250.00s -> 3253.00s]  How to conduct public meetings.
[3253.00s -> 3261.00s]  I mean, we may run a foul of those potentially in in our in the association in particular dentures association for discussing because.
[3261.00s -> 3268.00s]  This this dentures board if we get what three or four of us in the room chatting or from now what I've heard.
[3268.00s -> 3276.00s]  Two, two people talking about it like I feel like now I've been told by Sammy I can't go to lunch with Dr. Schwant and.
[3276.00s -> 3282.00s]  And talk about about his concerns and my concerns so without it being a public meeting.
[3282.00s -> 3289.00s]  Because we're serving on the same board. Is that is that what I'm hearing you say, Sammy?
[3289.00s -> 3291.00s]  No, she's not at her desk.
[3291.00s -> 3292.00s]  Okay.
[3292.00s -> 3293.00s]  Okay.
[3293.00s -> 3294.00s]  Yeah.
[3294.00s -> 3299.00s]  What she's trying to say is you just want to be careful.
[3299.00s -> 3300.00s]  You know what I mean?
[3300.00s -> 3301.00s]  Yeah.
[3301.00s -> 3308.00s]  Two is not a quorum. However, but you know, anybody can make an allegation.
[3308.00s -> 3311.00s]  Right. I guess I don't know what you mean, though.
[3311.00s -> 3317.00s]  How do you be careful in this situation? It sounds like there's, I mean, I feel like I'm being spied on.
[3317.00s -> 3318.00s]  Well, yeah.
[3318.00s -> 3328.00s]  I think we have a big enough association that we wouldn't have to pick people from the board to be on it from this board.
[3328.00s -> 3334.00s]  Yeah.
[3334.00s -> 3335.00s]  Yeah.
[3335.00s -> 3343.00s]  Maybe a culmination of folks not on the board and the dentist and.
[3343.00s -> 3353.00s]  The reality is the people on this board are the people that actually do things both at this state level and the association level.
[3354.00s -> 3355.00s]  Yeah.
[3355.00s -> 3357.00s]  It would be where a committee goes to die.
[3357.00s -> 3358.00s]  In my opinion.
[3358.00s -> 3359.00s]  And also.
[3359.00s -> 3360.00s]  Yeah.
[3360.00s -> 3362.00s]  Also this board is the.
[3362.00s -> 3365.00s]  This board is the group that makes those makes the rules.
[3365.00s -> 3368.00s]  The dental association isn't the licensing entity.
[3368.00s -> 3373.00s]  So the licensing to me is where the meat, the rubber is going to really meet the road.
[3373.00s -> 3376.00s]  The dental license association.
[3376.00s -> 3378.00s]  The dentist licensing.
[3378.00s -> 3379.00s]  Okay.
[3379.00s -> 3380.00s]  Yeah.
[3380.00s -> 3392.00s]  Well, protecting the public, I think that's the position that that doctors come in from as well as we're looking, I mean, are we're supposed to be protecting the public through.
[3392.00s -> 3398.00s]  Regulatory compliance, minimum competencies, stand, practice standards, and that.
[3398.00s -> 3401.00s]  And if we see something common that it's, it's not even coming.
[3401.00s -> 3403.00s]  It's already here.
[3404.00s -> 3406.00s]  We're already seeing it in our offices.
[3406.00s -> 3414.00s]  When you go to like literally fix a denture and you don't realize it at the time or one of the, the staff doesn't realize at the time they take it in.
[3414.00s -> 3416.00s]  And you go back there and you start to grind on.
[3416.00s -> 3417.00s]  Oh, wait a minute.
[3417.00s -> 3418.00s]  This grind's different.
[3418.00s -> 3421.00s]  Oh crap.
[3421.00s -> 3424.00s]  We can't get a tooth to stick in this thing.
[3424.00s -> 3432.00s]  Now you just ground on someone's denture and we just bought ourselves a denture that were rebuilding that was garbage to begin with.
[3432.00s -> 3434.00s]  That should have been in our patient's mouth.
[3434.00s -> 3435.00s]  So.
[3435.00s -> 3437.00s]  Yeah, one of those last week.
[3437.00s -> 3442.00s]  So I guess my point is it's sounding like we're not even allowed to talk about it.
[3442.00s -> 3444.00s]  And we're held in a little bubble here.
[3444.00s -> 3448.00s]  And we just got to wait until things crash and burn.
[3448.00s -> 3450.00s]  That just seems crazy to me.
[3450.00s -> 3456.00s]  I mean, I mean, maybe we can maybe we can discuss it in a public forum here and set aside time.
[3456.00s -> 3462.00s]  But we got to dig into the weeds on this because if we did that's where it's going to be happening.
[3462.00s -> 3464.00s]  It's all in in the weeds.
[3464.00s -> 3465.00s]  What?
[3465.00s -> 3466.00s]  And the workflow.
[3466.00s -> 3467.00s]  I appreciate the materials.
[3467.00s -> 3469.00s]  But the workflow is changing.
[3469.00s -> 3476.00s]  The setting of the occlusal plane is no longer in happening by the person who's looking at the patient.
[3476.00s -> 3479.00s]  It's happening a thousand miles away in Brazil.
[3479.00s -> 3481.00s]  By an unlicensed.
[3481.00s -> 3484.00s]  And they send it back to the doctor or to the dentist.
[3484.00s -> 3488.00s]  And then that person has this thing they just paid for.
[3488.00s -> 3490.00s]  And it took a week to get here.
[3490.00s -> 3492.00s]  And the patient now has to reappoint.
[3492.00s -> 3493.00s]  Come back in for another.
[3493.00s -> 3496.00s]  And maybe they're driving a hundred miles for this visit.
[3496.00s -> 3499.00s]  And the occlusal plane is off.
[3499.00s -> 3500.00s]  Well, okay.
[3500.00s -> 3502.00s]  Now what?
[3502.00s -> 3504.00s]  How do you deal with that digitally?
[3504.00s -> 3507.00s]  The way I deal with it with a dental lab.
[3507.00s -> 3511.00s]  If it's not my lab here in the office, which is wonderful.
[3511.00s -> 3516.00s]  The way we deal with it is I say, okay, I'll take a new bite and we'll have the lab reset it.
[3516.00s -> 3519.00s]  And I'll see you two days from now and we'll get it fixed.
[3519.00s -> 3524.00s]  You can't do that with the digital workflow.
[3524.00s -> 3525.00s]  That's the problem.
[3525.00s -> 3534.00s]  That to me is the crux of the whole issue is that we're taking things that should be done by the licensed individuals.
[3534.00s -> 3542.00s]  And we're off loading that in reality to people who know nothing about what we all trained on.
[3542.00s -> 3547.00s]  And they're from a practical standpoint, showing it down the throats of the industry.
[3547.00s -> 3550.00s]  And I don't think that's a good thing for the patient.
[3550.00s -> 3553.00s]  So to follow that, I think I'll just say it wrong.
[3553.00s -> 3559.00s]  So I believe that and I with respect to Grant and where where this should go.
[3559.00s -> 3562.00s]  I feel like that we need to have a committee.
[3562.00s -> 3570.00s]  That's formed of this board of dentists, dentures that can discuss this.
[3570.00s -> 3574.00s]  We can still put it out to our association for input.
[3574.00s -> 3579.00s]  But just just like when we when we wrote the test questions for the parcels.
[3579.00s -> 3584.00s]  When that law was enacted back in 2002, we formed a committee.
[3584.00s -> 3588.00s]  We had Dr. Sharp on the board at the time.
[3588.00s -> 3593.00s]  And he and Tad and Sean and I wrote test questions for three months.
[3593.00s -> 3595.00s]  We had multiple meetings.
[3595.00s -> 3601.00s]  And so maybe this is a working committee that reaches out to the association for input.
[3601.00s -> 3604.00s]  But that way we can we can have these meetings.
[3604.00s -> 3608.00s]  That and actually gets because I can see there.
[3608.00s -> 3611.00s]  These meetings lasting an hour and a half.
[3611.00s -> 3616.00s]  You just didn't bouncing off what what our concerns are to work towards.
[3616.00s -> 3624.00s]  What potentially that that we can do to regulate or set in place protections for the public.
[3624.00s -> 3632.00s]  So what can we can we form a committee like that and and not have a I mean invite members.
[3632.00s -> 3637.00s]  Licensed members of this board to participate on it.
[3637.00s -> 3639.00s]  We can I don't know.
[3639.00s -> 3643.00s]  Sammy's back on or not. We can do community engagement meeting.
[3643.00s -> 3646.00s]  And we can do it right here at HLO.
[3646.00s -> 3654.00s]  We've got a big room and you you tell Sammy who you want to be invited.
[3654.00s -> 3660.00s]  You know what professional or professionals that you know that need to come to the table.
[3660.00s -> 3663.00s]  Unless so we have a statutory authority.
[3663.00s -> 3667.00s]  We can't write a rule around it.
[3667.00s -> 3669.00s]  We're not even asking to write a rule yet.
[3669.00s -> 3670.00s]  Yeah.
[3670.00s -> 3671.00s]  Yeah.
[3671.00s -> 3673.00s]  Now I totally get what you're saying.
[3673.00s -> 3678.00s]  I know I but I heard you know changing rules laws or whatever.
[3678.00s -> 3681.00s]  You know what it what that looks ends up looking like.
[3681.00s -> 3684.00s]  If it's a statutory change.
[3684.00s -> 3691.00s]  The associations may need to bring it to a legislator to carry.
[3691.00s -> 3692.00s]  Right.
[3692.00s -> 3696.00s]  The vice vice vice vice vice vice vice vice president has a high score.
[3696.00s -> 3699.00s]  Which is not a city but because they Chalo doesn't do that.
[3699.00s -> 3703.00s]  But I'll talk to Sammy.
[3703.00s -> 3704.00s]  Off line and let her know.
[3704.00s -> 3708.00s]  And she can come back and listen to the recording too and help us figure out she's been,
[3708.00s -> 3710.00s]  she's been around quite a while.
[3710.00s -> 3712.00s]  And knows this like the back of her hand.
[3712.00s -> 3714.00s]  But you know somebody.
[3714.00s -> 3720.00s]  You know thing that comes to mind is community engagement for us and.
[3720.00s -> 3724.00s]  you know, it's just if you're talking board business, that's when you start talking board business,
[3724.00s -> 3728.88s]  I'm not sure what doc and I are going to be chatting about. I mean, like I'm sure we'll find
[3728.88s -> 3735.36s]  common ground in that, right? But it fits. I mean, the, yes. What's industry business and what's
[3735.36s -> 3740.32s]  board business? What's the difference? Because this is an industry issue.
[3742.64s -> 3747.44s]  And it's not necessarily making rules. We're just trying to, I'm just trying to get my arms around
[3748.08s -> 3756.00s]  the monster and see what is happening before we even talk about what may make the, the reasonable
[3756.72s -> 3761.92s]  rules. We're not talking about making rules. We're talking about understanding the shift that
[3761.92s -> 3769.04s]  will naturally come from moving from an analog environment to a digital environment. I can see
[3769.04s -> 3774.32s]  the trends already developing. I've got an idea already of how this is going to go, but I don't
[3774.32s -> 3783.60s]  know if I'm right. Okay. So, I mean, hey, Dr. Justice wants. Yeah, this is a stress. I've been
[3783.60s -> 3792.16s]  digital for about two years now, totally digital. 100% in the clinics, 100% in laboratories, now
[3792.88s -> 3800.40s]  scanning, 3D printing, designing. We have our own in-house designers. We have some outside
[3800.40s -> 3807.84s]  designers. I say you're concerned. We're actually milling all our own products. I think there's
[3807.84s -> 3814.80s]  going to be enough dentures that we can reach out to in our state. There's, I mean, there's not that
[3814.80s -> 3820.24s]  many of this on digital, but it's going this way super fast. I get it. There's dentures and
[3820.24s -> 3829.28s]  Washington. There's a lot of dentures in Canada. I, I, I send a digital conference every year in Canada.
[3829.28s -> 3837.12s]  And these Canadian guys love to share insights, knowledge. They've helped us a lot.
[3837.76s -> 3844.16s]  But where I'm going with that is there's a, the denserest body as a whole comes to the table with
[3844.16s -> 3850.56s]  a lot of expertise and experience. I think they would answer a lot of your questions, answer a lot
[3850.56s -> 3858.56s]  of concerns on products. You know, for instance, I won't spend much time. We started out trying to
[3858.56s -> 3863.44s]  3D print immediate dentures. So we thought that was going to be a really cool way to go. We found
[3863.44s -> 3870.00s]  that after six cases that were miserable failures. And so I know there's better 3D printing products
[3870.00s -> 3876.00s]  out there. But, but anyway, we've ridden this roller coaster. And I totally understand where you
[3876.00s -> 3882.56s]  come from with regards to questions you have with, you know, work is my seropinus. I think there's
[3882.56s -> 3889.36s]  those are a lot of things that can be answered. I think that the dentures are really in a position
[3889.36s -> 3894.56s]  now where they come to the table with a ton of analog experience, many, many, many years.
[3896.00s -> 3900.96s]  Much of those same concepts, they don't go away when you're dealing with digital. You just have
[3900.96s -> 3908.88s]  to look at the beast a little bit differently. But again, I think as a whole, I would encourage
[3909.60s -> 3915.28s]  Dr. Schwan to come to us. We've done that kind of conference. I think there's going to be a lot
[3915.28s -> 3919.44s]  of stuff going on there. But I think that I'm sorry, I think that we've got to come to what?
[3921.20s -> 3926.72s]  We've got to come to up and up in May. We've got a conference coming up in May. And the
[3926.72s -> 3934.48s]  conference is now largely digital. But I think the idea as a board to come up with some kind of a
[3934.48s -> 3945.04s]  committee to definitely regulate and protect. I think it's great. And I think it can be done.
[3945.04s -> 3949.68s]  I don't know how to get there. But I think that we come to the table with a lot of experience
[3950.24s -> 3956.56s]  that's out there that they can help us. Can I get your contact, can I get his contact info so
[3956.56s -> 3960.48s]  that I can find out more about this conference or how would I learn more about that conference?
[3960.48s -> 3966.56s]  If you go on the Oregon State Dentures Association website, Oregon State Dentures Association
[3966.56s -> 3971.36s]  website, it's actually going to be a joint conference with the Oregon Association,
[3971.36s -> 3977.68s]  the Washington Association, and the Washington Dental Laboratory Association. The first weekend in
[3977.68s -> 3985.92s]  May, it's going to be in Vancouver, Washington. And I believe it's a Friday Saturday event.
[3985.92s -> 3990.56s]  Got it. Ron.
[3991.76s -> 3997.84s]  Yeah, I think thank you for bringing up the association's input on what the board does.
[3999.12s -> 4003.04s]  I could say back in the day, I did this whole time, Roy said, we didn't do anything without
[4003.04s -> 4008.32s]  the association, knowing what we were doing first. And that hasn't happened in a really, really
[4008.32s -> 4014.48s]  long time. I've tried to get committees when we talk about removing college education and get
[4014.48s -> 4019.92s]  association involved and about the past fail concept. Does it ensure us out there? Does
[4019.92s -> 4025.28s]  association know what's being discussed here? No, they don't. And talking to the members of
[4025.28s -> 4030.32s]  association and some that are on the board, they didn't even know, they have no idea what we're
[4030.32s -> 4039.92s]  doing. And it's just, it's kind of disheartening that the association is not more involved in what we do.
[4040.08s -> 4046.88s]  So in this committee, can I just interrupt you and say that there's there's open
[4046.88s -> 4055.12s]  permission on the board? The board members that I talked to and the people that belong there,
[4055.12s -> 4061.52s]  when I ask about if they knew this was happening, I just got a no by the 100% of people I talk to.
[4061.52s -> 4067.44s]  And so, no, I appreciate your interrupting because you're representing the board, but the board
[4068.40s -> 4072.96s]  don't know they're being represented and how they're being represented. So I think this
[4074.16s -> 4081.12s]  this committee that I bring up that word many, many times, having one I think is just really,
[4081.12s -> 4087.92s]  really important. And I think you should move forward on having that and get as many members
[4087.92s -> 4093.84s]  from the association that we can to put their input in there. I just totally support it,
[4093.84s -> 4100.48s]  Todd is what I'm saying. I just want more support. I just feel there hasn't been association support
[4100.48s -> 4108.72s]  in the movement over the last decade and more. So I stand, I stand interrupted, but I'm supporting
[4108.72s -> 4113.44s]  the support, Todd. Can we forward with committee or no? Bob, is that possible?
[4114.80s -> 4119.68s]  I offline, I, yeah, we can certainly have community engagement.
[4119.68s -> 4127.76s]  No, I mean, a committee, a committee to investigate this issue, the public.
[4129.20s -> 4134.48s]  Is that within the purview of this committee, but within the powers of this board,
[4134.48s -> 4140.16s]  or is that something that the board cannot form a subcommittee to investigate the development of
[4140.16s -> 4148.80s]  technology? I'll have to check into that. Oh, a committee can be formed to do, yeah,
[4148.80s -> 4157.36s]  can work members or of other people? Other people. Oh, well, then I would move to form a committee
[4157.36s -> 4164.56s]  to investigate emerging technologies in the dentures profession. I say that it can be done.
[4165.36s -> 4169.36s]  However, timing and staffing, I don't probably have to weigh in on that.
[4169.36s -> 4176.40s]  Yeah, so would they, you were on your other meeting, but while you were gone, the discussion came
[4176.40s -> 4184.40s]  up about emerging technologies and safety with product, and Todd has something to say.
[4185.28s -> 4192.40s]  Well, we have a motion and we have a second. Bob, so we can have discussion now and input
[4192.40s -> 4204.16s]  from HLO staff to find out if, so at this point, if we have a motion, a second, we're in discussion,
[4205.04s -> 4210.24s]  is that I heard from Sammy that we can have it, but it's a question of resources.
[4211.28s -> 4217.12s]  So if we vote to do this, and this is part of the discussion I'm having right now with this motion,
[4218.08s -> 4226.80s]  then it's an allocation of resources, of staff resources, and notification for public comment,
[4226.80s -> 4236.40s]  or public interaction, or whatever. So it seems to me that if we take a vote here, it very likely
[4236.40s -> 4242.96s]  is going to pass that we want to have a committee formed. So then can we just put it in your hands
[4242.96s -> 4250.88s]  to make it happen? So am I understanding a committee formed to discuss emerging technologies
[4251.84s -> 4261.92s]  and public safety? Or in community outreach? I believe that Dr. Schwann should restate his motion,
[4261.92s -> 4272.40s]  specifically to what the direction and the funnel of what we're discussing here,
[4272.96s -> 4280.32s]  relative to that public safety. I would say I suppose a committee to investigate the emerging
[4280.32s -> 4291.20s]  technology and the profession of dendtourism and its impact on the profession. Is there somebody
[4291.20s -> 4296.96s]  that could more discussion? Is there somebody that could be designated as a subject matter expert
[4296.96s -> 4302.64s]  for me so I can call and get clarification? Like, remember Bruce Todd? Dr. Schwann.
[4303.20s -> 4310.00s]  I recommend you go after himself. I'll do it. I think the gentleman that was talking that is
[4310.00s -> 4316.56s]  fully digital is also an excellent subject matter expert, and I think Todd with an excellent subject
[4316.56s -> 4323.60s]  matter expert. It's important for me to know like what's the policy direction we're trying to go.
[4323.76s -> 4331.28s]  We don't know yet. We're literally investigating potential, the threat to the Oregon public
[4331.28s -> 4338.24s]  with emerging technology, and there's going to be different sides of this. I think there's
[4338.24s -> 4344.56s]  going to be bigger discussion whether it's materials based, whether it's process based, whether it's
[4345.44s -> 4354.48s]  source based, it's all of that. It needs to be fleshed out amongst the licensees to figure out
[4354.48s -> 4364.48s]  what if in fact there is a threat, and then at some point reaching out to interested parties or
[4364.48s -> 4374.88s]  bodies for input in how and what to to potentially implement as far as regulations or statute.
[4375.44s -> 4380.80s]  Does that make sense? Yeah, I'll just leave it up to Bob. And Sammy, if you want, if you want,
[4380.80s -> 4388.80s]  I could do, I'll do that. Okay, great. So is there any further discussion on the motion
[4389.44s -> 4396.64s]  presented by Dr. Schwamp? No further discussion. Call the question, all those in favor.
[4398.00s -> 4411.28s]  Chris Chapman. I. Ron Ferris. I. Grant Smith. I. Dr. Schwamp. I.
[4411.28s -> 4413.28s]  I.
[4413.28s -> 4422.80s]  I. The motion carries at the pleasure of the staff with Dr. Schwamp being the lead or the conference
[4422.80s -> 4434.72s]  chair to determine next meeting times, proper notification, all of that. So. Okay. Any further.
[4436.24s -> 4441.12s]  Any other further board business? I would just want to make sure our expectations
[4441.28s -> 4448.48s]  are clear that this is definitely a resource thing. And I don't know what your timeline is,
[4448.48s -> 4455.92s]  but please be aware of that. Hopefully we would we would have a conference committee meeting before
[4455.92s -> 4460.00s]  the next board meeting, which is scheduled six months from now, right?
[4460.00s -> 4469.52s]  Um, I'll let Bob answer that. Um, so the next board meetings September 25.
[4470.80s -> 4477.76s]  It with legislation and everything that comes up after signing die, we've got some huge bills.
[4479.52s -> 4486.64s]  Sign languages being revamped. License dieticians is being totally revamped. So
[4487.60s -> 4497.36s]  both analysts and we have dental lab. And I think we're at rule making. Yeah. So but we,
[4497.36s -> 4503.44s]  you know, fortunately, we're fully staffed. And maybe we can make it happen offline. I'll have
[4503.44s -> 4510.40s]  a discussion with Sammy and other analysts and see what we can come up with to get the appropriate
[4510.40s -> 4515.60s]  people notified, get the appropriate people in the room. Dr. Schwamp, thank you very much. And you
[4517.20s -> 4524.32s]  let Sammy give her an idea of who you want and who you need. And we'll do our best to put it together.
[4524.32s -> 4529.68s]  And it can be either online or in here at HLO or hybrid.
[4531.04s -> 4537.84s]  mixture of both. Whatever it takes. So. Okay. Thank you. We'll do. Appreciate. We'll do what we can do.
[4537.84s -> 4541.12s]  Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you, Sammy.
[4541.12s -> 4546.56s]  Yeah. Thank you, Sammy. Open business. No problem.
[4548.72s -> 4552.32s]  Okay. It's almost for this being the quiet board. Oh, I mean,
[4556.08s -> 4561.52s]  just Josh and I love it. All right. Well, with that being said, do we need a motion to adjourn or
[4561.52s -> 4567.04s]  can I just adjourn it? You're going to adjourn it. If you don't have to get a motion but if everybody's
[4567.04s -> 4572.00s]  done, we can you can certainly adjourn us. Everyone dead?
[4574.16s -> 4582.08s]  Twice. Board of Jenture Technology meeting is adjourned at 1021 AM on May, excuse me, March 13th,
[4582.08s -> 4586.24s]  2025. Thank you all for always. Thank you, everybody. Really appreciate.
