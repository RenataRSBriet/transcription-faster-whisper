[0.00s -> 2.30s]  three, two, four.
[2.30s -> 5.04s]  So that's for the public like to sign in.
[5.04s -> 7.20s]  Public site people leave the meeting.
[7.20s -> 9.44s]  Go to your email, sign in to the other meeting.
[10.44s -> 11.44s]  Bye.
[11.44s -> 12.28s]  All right.
[12.28s -> 13.60s]  Thank you.
[13.60s -> 14.76s]  Public site.
[14.76s -> 15.60s]  Thanks everybody.
[18.24s -> 19.88s]  I'm trying to get out of here.
[20.88s -> 23.20s]  Well, let's just give people another 30 seconds
[23.20s -> 25.68s]  to get to their right meeting.
[25.68s -> 29.40s]  Nancy, what's the public site number?
[29.40s -> 31.60s]  That's not your pencil.
[31.60s -> 38.40s]  298, 007, 6324.
[38.40s -> 41.20s]  That's for the public site building.
[41.20s -> 43.88s]  You're going to go into your email.
[43.88s -> 44.72s]  Yeah, I got it.
[44.72s -> 45.48s]  I got it.
[45.48s -> 48.40s]  And click on the email and click on that for the email.
[48.40s -> 51.20s]  But Dion, I don't have a way to leave the meeting.
[51.20s -> 53.44s]  It says the only thing I can do is end the meeting.
[53.88s -> 59.68s]  So if I do, if I do that, will I stop your meeting?
[68.20s -> 68.68s]  OK.
[68.68s -> 70.76s]  How do I do that?
[70.76s -> 71.28s]  OK.
[76.00s -> 76.88s]  OK.
[76.88s -> 79.88s]  Thanks, Nick.
[79.88s -> 81.08s]  I have participants.
[81.08s -> 82.60s]  And I see invite mute.
[90.88s -> 92.60s]  Not the me one, but the other one.
[92.60s -> 93.40s]  Let's see.
[93.40s -> 114.76s]  OK, done.
[114.76s -> 116.08s]  So then I can leave the meeting now
[116.08s -> 117.60s]  and I'll go join the other one.
[117.60s -> 118.92s]  Thank you.
[118.92s -> 119.96s]  Bye, Nancy.
[119.96s -> 120.48s]  Bye.
[124.40s -> 127.24s]  Dion, are you still with us?
[127.24s -> 129.24s]  I am still here.
[129.24s -> 129.68s]  OK, all right.
[129.68s -> 131.76s]  Well, we're good to go, you think?
[131.76s -> 133.48s]  Yeah, we're ready to go.
[133.48s -> 137.24s]  We like to call to order this meeting, virtual,
[137.24s -> 143.80s]  and pertinence on this Tuesday, April 14, 2020.
[143.80s -> 146.56s]  And I'd like us all to start with the Pledge of Allegiance.
[146.56s -> 155.80s]  I pledge allegiance to the White House of the United States
[155.80s -> 160.80s]  of America to the Republic for the Wichestan's
[160.80s -> 165.64s]  Nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.
[171.36s -> 174.68s]  I think we probably learned a little bit
[174.68s -> 179.08s]  in that discussion, how to separate the two calls.
[179.08s -> 182.96s]  But just to go through again, I believe we have some people
[182.96s -> 188.00s]  who are on the line for the meeting just on a telephone.
[188.00s -> 194.96s]  To those people, you can use the star, nine function.
[194.96s -> 199.44s]  And we, Dion, in particular, will see an icon that you are
[199.44s -> 201.00s]  raising your hand.
[201.00s -> 208.28s]  And you would like to just on the phone, you can get star, nine.
[208.28s -> 210.72s]  And Dion, to be able to see that you'd like to talk,
[210.72s -> 213.48s]  and then she'll recognize you kind of in the order
[213.48s -> 217.08s]  as people come in.
[217.08s -> 218.92s]  As for all the folks who are in the picture,
[218.92s -> 220.92s]  I think you can see that you basically
[220.92s -> 224.40s]  have the same functionality through Zoom.
[224.40s -> 228.00s]  You can raise your hand through the raise your hand function.
[228.00s -> 229.12s]  And we'll do the same thing.
[229.12s -> 234.04s]  Where Dion will try to keep this as a sequential thing.
[234.04s -> 236.68s]  As soon as you get into the queue to speak,
[236.68s -> 241.60s]  then Dion will recognize folks in that order.
[241.60s -> 244.76s]  I think that is about all for now.
[244.76s -> 246.96s]  Dion adds to just the logistics.
[250.96s -> 252.44s]  I think we're good.
[252.44s -> 259.08s]  And I will try to call you in order, so bear with me.
[259.60s -> 261.72s]  Sorry, Dion.
[261.72s -> 262.96s]  Yes.
[262.96s -> 264.64s]  Are you going to mute us like a member
[264.64s -> 266.72s]  when we tried last night that you would unmute
[266.72s -> 268.92s]  as you pick the person?
[268.92s -> 272.96s]  Well, as while we were talking today,
[272.96s -> 277.80s]  as far as I know, the way I understand it
[277.80s -> 283.60s]  when Nick was excited, I really can't mute everybody.
[283.60s -> 286.36s]  So we're just going to have to use our manners
[286.36s -> 288.56s]  and not talk over each other.
[288.56s -> 290.28s]  OK, I didn't know if you were going to leave the board
[290.28s -> 293.36s]  of finance unmuted and mute after public comment, that's all.
[293.36s -> 297.08s]  Yeah, let me just see how this goes, OK?
[297.08s -> 297.84s]  Sure.
[297.84s -> 299.36s]  All right, thanks.
[299.36s -> 302.76s]  Just a general request is for folks to be patient.
[302.76s -> 304.32s]  It's the first time we're going through this.
[304.32s -> 306.88s]  And I think we're going to have some bumps in the road
[306.88s -> 309.08s]  as already demonstrated.
[309.08s -> 311.64s]  This is the first virtual meeting of the board of finance
[311.64s -> 313.28s]  on a way we're kind of making history.
[313.28s -> 315.84s]  So there's points.
[315.84s -> 319.00s]  Not far the largest.
[319.00s -> 321.52s]  And so at this point, we enter on the agenda
[321.52s -> 324.36s]  the segment for public comment.
[324.36s -> 327.52s]  So then I would ask the people who have a phone
[327.52s -> 330.76s]  to use the star 9 functionality
[330.76s -> 335.12s]  and the folks who are in whom to use the raise your hand
[335.12s -> 338.76s]  functionality and Dion will recognize you for comment.
[338.96s -> 339.96s]  Yeah.
[342.76s -> 348.20s]  So at this point, turning it over to you, Dion.
[348.20s -> 356.16s]  So if Brad cults, if you, I'm going to unmute.
[356.16s -> 359.84s]  OK, Brad, are you there?
[359.84s -> 360.80s]  Can you hear me?
[360.80s -> 362.96s]  Yes, I can hear you.
[362.96s -> 366.00s]  And just one other thing I will need for you
[366.00s -> 371.64s]  to give me your name and your address.
[371.64s -> 376.24s]  Brad cults, one fair child drive Bethel.
[376.24s -> 378.76s]  Thank you.
[378.76s -> 380.88s]  Thank you.
[380.88s -> 384.68s]  I have two comments to share.
[384.68s -> 389.24s]  One, I wanted to share that the Bethel Business Network.
[389.24s -> 391.00s]  We had an informal survey.
[391.00s -> 395.32s]  We've got about 117 members now.
[395.32s -> 399.32s]  100% of the roughly 25% of our members
[399.32s -> 404.20s]  that shared either by phone or email their opinions.
[404.20s -> 408.44s]  100% of the business members that we were able to survey
[408.44s -> 413.84s]  oppose an increase in the mill rate for this fiscal year.
[413.84s -> 416.84s]  I just want to point out that the business community
[416.84s -> 421.00s]  is especially hard to hit, whether it's a restaurant
[421.00s -> 423.60s]  who has lost all of their dining revenue,
[423.60s -> 427.56s]  businesses that have had to close, but still have rent,
[427.56s -> 429.64s]  and other expenses.
[429.64s -> 432.16s]  These folks are deeply hurt.
[432.16s -> 435.28s]  And the fact that there's some low-cost loans and things
[435.28s -> 437.76s]  available does not mean they're going
[437.76s -> 439.40s]  to survive this crisis.
[439.40s -> 444.08s]  So there was a very deep sentiment about that.
[444.08s -> 445.44s]  I also want to point out that there
[445.44s -> 449.28s]  is a fair amount of confusion that came out
[449.28s -> 452.20s]  during many of these conversations.
[452.20s -> 455.00s]  Many folks have not read the entire budget.
[455.00s -> 458.32s]  I know it's a shock to everybody on the board.
[458.32s -> 462.12s]  There is a general misconception,
[462.12s -> 465.28s]  based on a lot of social media chat, I believe,
[465.28s -> 469.64s]  that the current budget with this, the proposed increase
[469.64s -> 473.64s]  that came out from your last formal meeting
[473.64s -> 475.52s]  where you were going to present that,
[475.52s -> 479.60s]  I believe, to the town for town meeting,
[479.60s -> 484.68s]  that that projected increase included funds for,
[484.68s -> 488.08s]  and earmarked for COVID-specific services,
[488.08s -> 490.68s]  and it's my understanding that it doesn't.
[490.68s -> 493.68s]  So I was going to hope that someone on the board,
[493.68s -> 496.08s]  at some point, could speak to that.
[496.08s -> 499.08s]  And I just want to share switching years
[499.08s -> 502.24s]  that on a personal level, it's my hope
[502.24s -> 505.00s]  that the board will sharpen their pencils,
[505.00s -> 508.00s]  realizing the deep devastation that's already happening,
[508.16s -> 511.00s]  and I think we're only midway through this crisis
[511.00s -> 515.48s]  and actually find the ability to actually cut
[515.48s -> 519.16s]  this budget from the current year rather than increase it.
[519.16s -> 520.92s]  So those are my comments,
[520.92s -> 523.08s]  and I appreciate the opportunity to share them.
[523.08s -> 527.28s]  And I have to say, having done a number of these over the years,
[527.28s -> 529.64s]  this is actually off to a pretty good start, Bob.
[529.64s -> 530.80s]  So thank you.
[531.88s -> 532.72s]  Brad, thank you.
[534.40s -> 536.48s]  Let me just answer the question
[536.48s -> 538.32s]  regarding the COVID-19 expenses.
[538.32s -> 541.28s]  Should someone else in the queue have the same question?
[541.28s -> 544.56s]  The budget that this board of finance put together,
[544.56s -> 547.76s]  and I'll go through, I'll recap kind of the process
[547.76s -> 549.96s]  that we went through and how we got to today,
[549.96s -> 553.20s]  but the budget that this board of finance
[553.20s -> 556.04s]  looked at last for purposes of bringing to the public,
[556.04s -> 558.00s]  hearing for further public input,
[558.00s -> 560.80s]  did not include COVID-19 expenses.
[561.72s -> 564.00s]  It was a, that budget,
[564.00s -> 566.68s]  that proposal was a pre-COVID-19 world budget.
[566.68s -> 569.04s]  Hello, this is Gil, am I in the right meeting?
[570.80s -> 574.00s]  Gil, no, I think you want the public site.
[575.24s -> 576.08s]  Check your e.
[576.08s -> 579.96s]  I'm in, I'm in, I can't get there.
[581.80s -> 582.80s]  This is the first day of the meeting.
[582.80s -> 584.08s]  You are more than welcome.
[585.88s -> 587.20s]  Thank you very much, Poetite.
[587.20s -> 588.20s]  I'd like to be in the meeting
[588.20s -> 590.52s]  and I'm supposed to be all hang up and try again.
[594.52s -> 595.36s]  Next.
[601.64s -> 603.92s]  Thank you for clearing that up, Bob.
[603.92s -> 604.92s]  Certainly, thank you.
[607.44s -> 609.44s]  Okay, Billy Michaels.
[610.44s -> 611.44s]  In my life.
[612.84s -> 613.84s]  Can you hear me?
[613.84s -> 614.84s]  That's right.
[614.84s -> 615.84s]  Manate yourself.
[615.84s -> 617.00s]  This is Stephanie's friend.
[617.00s -> 617.84s]  All right, Billy.
[617.84s -> 618.36s]  No, no.
[618.36s -> 619.84s]  Yeah, there have to unmute something.
[619.84s -> 620.64s]  It's not possible.
[620.64s -> 621.92s]  No, we can hear you.
[621.92s -> 622.92s]  Okay.
[622.92s -> 623.92s]  Okay.
[624.56s -> 626.32s]  Big, big, cut.
[626.32s -> 627.36s]  I'll sign it.
[627.36s -> 628.36s]  Every single time.
[628.36s -> 630.24s]  I'm sorry, but he's opening him off.
[630.24s -> 632.72s]  If you're not the speaker, could you
[632.72s -> 633.96s]  come over please?
[634.96s -> 635.88s]  Board of Finance.
[637.12s -> 638.32s]  Because of the voices.
[638.32s -> 639.84s]  I'm voted that the board of finance
[639.84s -> 641.40s]  can set the board of head meeting.
[642.40s -> 643.40s]  Excuse me.
[643.40s -> 645.00s]  Yeah, I don't know whose voice that is.
[645.00s -> 646.20s]  I don't either.
[646.96s -> 648.44s]  The functionality is working.
[648.44s -> 649.72s]  It's a Michelle.
[650.44s -> 652.28s]  Oh, man.
[652.28s -> 653.28s]  Michelle, thank you.
[653.28s -> 654.76s]  I think you can mute your phone.
[654.76s -> 655.76s]  Well,
[663.24s -> 664.56s]  tell me when I'm ready.
[664.56s -> 665.64s]  You're ready.
[665.64s -> 667.48s]  Okay, Billy Michael 27 and a half
[667.48s -> 668.68s]  Fleetwood Avenue.
[668.68s -> 671.40s]  Mr. Manfried has started this meeting,
[671.40s -> 673.96s]  this nightmare of a meeting as far as
[673.96s -> 675.36s]  citizen participation goes.
[676.76s -> 679.68s]  He starts with the the pledge of allegiance.
[679.68s -> 682.32s]  Incentral to that pledge of allegiance
[682.32s -> 684.64s]  is the consent of the governed.
[684.64s -> 687.36s]  And this budget process denying the citizens
[687.36s -> 689.88s]  a right to vote on this budget.
[689.88s -> 693.12s]  And to have seven people on a board of finance decide,
[693.12s -> 694.60s]  I don't know how many people on the board
[694.60s -> 697.16s]  of the seven people lost their jobs.
[697.16s -> 700.72s]  But everything that I have read from anybody
[700.72s -> 703.28s]  with a budget in this town that constructs a budget,
[703.28s -> 704.84s]  they have jobs.
[704.84s -> 709.64s]  Everybody that has a job is lobbying the board of finance
[709.80s -> 712.36s]  who I'm assuming have jobs to raise taxes
[712.36s -> 714.52s]  are people that don't have jobs.
[714.52s -> 717.32s]  I know one person in town, a 20,000 people
[717.32s -> 718.76s]  that has the virus.
[718.76s -> 722.76s]  I know hundreds of people that are out of work,
[722.76s -> 725.44s]  hundreds of people that are out of work.
[725.44s -> 730.44s]  And we are going to raise taxes on them without a referendum.
[730.80s -> 732.32s]  And there's no pushback.
[732.32s -> 737.32s]  There's 82 towns with budget referendum.
[737.60s -> 739.00s]  And there's no crime.
[739.00s -> 741.12s]  Where's the people pushing back against the decree
[741.12s -> 745.44s]  that robs us of our most fundamental freedom?
[745.44s -> 750.60s]  I see this as a complete exploitation of our citizens' rights
[750.60s -> 754.92s]  because of this medical emergency, this decree.
[754.92s -> 758.52s]  So I think that we should have an uprising
[758.52s -> 761.28s]  to push the decision back.
[761.28s -> 763.04s]  We have all the way to June 30th.
[763.04s -> 765.40s]  I don't know why this rush.
[765.40s -> 768.28s]  Every time there's a rush in this town,
[768.28s -> 769.88s]  I get suspicious.
[769.88s -> 773.88s]  There was a rush to get the aquarium water pass.
[773.88s -> 775.08s]  Fast, let's get this done.
[775.08s -> 776.76s]  Let's get this to a referendum.
[776.76s -> 778.84s]  I don't think we need time.
[778.84s -> 780.88s]  I think things are going to change over time.
[780.88s -> 783.24s]  So I'm against this whole process
[783.24s -> 785.36s]  that rushes this process into May.
[785.36s -> 786.40s]  We have plenty of time.
[786.40s -> 789.00s]  I remember 1998, we had six referendums.
[789.00s -> 791.92s]  We were voting in August and the town didn't stop.
[791.92s -> 795.16s]  And people had the right to vote on a budget.
[795.16s -> 798.24s]  We did not lose our basic fundamental freedoms.
[798.52s -> 800.12s]  And I'll remember another day,
[800.12s -> 804.12s]  there was a year in 1992, we had three or four referendums.
[804.12s -> 806.28s]  And this has got to do with part of the budget.
[806.28s -> 808.12s]  We have people that are out of work.
[808.12s -> 810.16s]  We have people that are going to lose their ability
[810.16s -> 812.52s]  to pay their rent, pay their mortgages.
[812.52s -> 816.56s]  They're going to be like this critical chaos in their life.
[816.56s -> 819.00s]  And in our budget, everybody's getting raises.
[819.00s -> 823.64s]  In the schools, we got $188,000 worth of raises
[823.64s -> 825.92s]  for 17 school administrators.
[825.92s -> 828.40s]  The reason I brought up the early 1990s
[828.40s -> 830.84s]  was when Darlin O'Connor was the head
[830.84s -> 833.72s]  of the Board of Education facing three referendums.
[833.72s -> 839.28s]  The school administrators voluntarily took out their increases.
[839.28s -> 841.32s]  And this is a time to do it now.
[841.32s -> 843.36s]  To go back to the school administration.
[843.36s -> 845.36s]  Where's all this inequality of income?
[845.36s -> 848.44s]  The people, the where are all vessels?
[848.44s -> 850.68s]  Occupied Wall Street supporters.
[850.68s -> 853.56s]  This is the 1% versus the 99%.
[853.56s -> 857.72s]  How can this budget, a 3 1 1% tax increase,
[857.72s -> 860.32s]  be placed on people who have lost their jobs,
[860.32s -> 865.20s]  give raises to people making $150,000?
[865.20s -> 869.84s]  The immorality of this, in every single aspect
[869.84s -> 873.32s]  of this event, grows government.
[873.32s -> 875.96s]  Everything, we need money because the grand list grows.
[875.96s -> 876.76s]  The grand list is growing.
[876.76s -> 879.04s]  Just to help people, oh wait, the grand list is growing.
[879.04s -> 880.96s]  We need more people in the building department.
[880.96s -> 882.72s]  We need people for the inspectors.
[882.76s -> 884.88s]  We need people, we need people, we need people.
[884.88s -> 887.00s]  Okay, then we have trouble
[887.00s -> 888.08s]  because people don't have money.
[888.08s -> 890.12s]  So we need more social services.
[890.12s -> 892.72s]  There is no, we have the kids out of school.
[892.72s -> 893.80s]  No one goes to school.
[893.80s -> 895.80s]  We need more money for distance learning.
[895.80s -> 898.04s]  Everything is seized as an opportunity
[898.04s -> 900.92s]  to grow and spend money by the government.
[900.92s -> 903.88s]  So you're a lot of people queuing up.
[903.88s -> 905.80s]  I've spoken my piece.
[905.80s -> 908.12s]  I'm against the spending.
[908.12s -> 909.72s]  I'm against the tax increase.
[909.72s -> 911.12s]  I'm against this.
[911.12s -> 914.40s]  The process of denying the people the right to vote.
[914.40s -> 916.56s]  And for this Board of Finance to be known
[916.56s -> 919.24s]  is the one in history that implements
[919.24s -> 924.04s]  a mill rate increase without the consent of the people
[924.04s -> 927.72s]  they are sworn to serve is just appalling to me.
[927.72s -> 929.88s]  Thank you for your time, Board of Finance.
[930.80s -> 932.28s]  Thank you.
[932.28s -> 933.40s]  Beyond that.
[933.40s -> 935.52s]  Yes, Bill Hillman.
[935.52s -> 939.36s]  Hi, thank you, Bill Hillman 86 Walnut Hill Road.
[939.36s -> 941.12s]  I had sent some correspondence.
[941.12s -> 943.08s]  You can read that on your own.
[943.08s -> 945.08s]  The main gist of that correspondence
[945.08s -> 947.40s]  echoes what Brad Cole said, which
[947.40s -> 951.32s]  is a zero increase to the mill rate.
[951.32s -> 954.44s]  Echoing everything that's been said so far,
[954.44s -> 956.60s]  people in this town are hurting.
[956.60s -> 960.80s]  Seriously, my wife is on unemployment.
[960.80s -> 964.00s]  I don't know of any person that doesn't have at least one
[964.00s -> 968.36s]  if not all wage earners on unemployment or hurting right now.
[968.36s -> 971.08s]  And it would be unconscionable for the town
[971.08s -> 974.60s]  to impose a raise, especially without a referendum
[974.60s -> 975.88s]  at this point.
[975.88s -> 978.76s]  Now, there's also some priorities.
[978.76s -> 982.68s]  Public safety is going to have to be a priority
[982.68s -> 984.44s]  for a number of months.
[984.44s -> 987.28s]  This peak that we're about to pass
[987.28s -> 989.72s]  doesn't mean that we're out of the woods.
[989.72s -> 991.68s]  So I know that the Board of Finance
[991.68s -> 994.68s]  has approved one additional headcount
[994.68s -> 996.16s]  for the police department.
[996.16s -> 1000.12s]  I know that Captain Pugner has requested two.
[1000.12s -> 1003.04s]  If there is to be an increase, it has
[1003.04s -> 1004.60s]  to be a zero sum game.
[1004.60s -> 1008.16s]  And the funding for that has to come from someplace else.
[1008.16s -> 1012.20s]  Add to that what would be over $1 million in cuts
[1012.20s -> 1016.08s]  to enable a zero change in the mill rate,
[1016.08s -> 1018.08s]  I think that's necessary.
[1018.08s -> 1020.92s]  And I understand it means that some town services
[1020.92s -> 1022.76s]  may have to be reduced.
[1022.76s -> 1025.04s]  Perhaps hours are reduced.
[1025.04s -> 1029.24s]  Perhaps wages and staff will need to be reduced.
[1029.24s -> 1034.04s]  Just like the families of most of Bethel are already reduced.
[1034.04s -> 1038.44s]  The Board of Finance meets to account for that.
[1038.44s -> 1042.56s]  One way to do it is to just pass last year's budgets forward
[1042.56s -> 1045.52s]  again, but that would also be irresponsible.
[1045.52s -> 1048.36s]  So I'd ask you to do everything that you can.
[1048.36s -> 1050.44s]  There are some members of the Board of Finance
[1050.44s -> 1053.56s]  who will later be proposing certain ideas
[1053.56s -> 1058.52s]  that in fact can achieve a zero increase to the mill rate.
[1058.52s -> 1062.00s]  I would ask that the majority listen very carefully
[1062.00s -> 1064.68s]  to the minority who will propose that,
[1064.68s -> 1068.56s]  and seriously consider any and all actions
[1068.56s -> 1071.12s]  that can keep the mill rate changed to zero.
[1071.12s -> 1072.88s]  Thank you.
[1072.88s -> 1075.20s]  Thank you.
[1075.20s -> 1076.12s]  Courtney Martin.
[1078.60s -> 1080.24s]  Oh, wait one second.
[1080.24s -> 1080.76s]  There you go.
[1083.56s -> 1087.24s]  All right, Courtney Martin, 38, Star Lane.
[1087.24s -> 1088.64s]  I'd first like to address the fact
[1088.64s -> 1092.28s]  that I am speaking to you tonight, not as a Board of Ed member,
[1092.28s -> 1095.84s]  but as a parent of three children in three separate schools
[1095.84s -> 1099.88s]  who are all currently receiving online distance learning.
[1099.88s -> 1102.00s]  Although I would like to commend the teachers,
[1102.00s -> 1104.36s]  the administrators and staff for the phenomenal job
[1104.36s -> 1108.60s]  they are doing with the limited resources that they have,
[1108.60s -> 1111.36s]  and their ability to put together an online program
[1111.36s -> 1113.24s]  as quickly as they did.
[1113.24s -> 1115.88s]  They should be commended for their efforts.
[1115.88s -> 1118.28s]  However, the honest and unfortunate truth
[1118.28s -> 1120.20s]  is that online distance learning
[1120.20s -> 1123.44s]  does not replace classroom instruction.
[1123.44s -> 1127.04s]  The real issue we are faced with is come September.
[1127.04s -> 1132.04s]  Every student will be behind in one way or another.
[1132.56s -> 1136.72s]  The question is how far behind are you willing to let them get?
[1138.32s -> 1140.92s]  It comes to a point where it's going to be impossible
[1140.92s -> 1142.44s]  for them to recover.
[1142.44s -> 1145.44s]  By reducing the funding that was proposed,
[1145.44s -> 1148.68s]  you will quite frankly be setting our children up for failure.
[1149.92s -> 1152.72s]  Before distance learning, we were already short staffed
[1152.72s -> 1156.00s]  on teachers, support staff, and interventionists.
[1156.00s -> 1157.64s]  By reducing the proposed budget,
[1157.64s -> 1160.60s]  you are not only further limiting the resources,
[1160.60s -> 1162.44s]  but hindering our ability to recover
[1162.44s -> 1164.80s]  from all the learning that was lost.
[1164.80s -> 1167.12s]  Future budgets will be affected
[1167.12s -> 1169.24s]  because more and more interventionists will be needed
[1169.24s -> 1172.24s]  to service the students who didn't need it before,
[1172.24s -> 1174.72s]  but they now can't catch up.
[1174.72s -> 1177.12s]  If class size increases further strain
[1177.12s -> 1178.52s]  will be put on the teachers
[1178.52s -> 1180.64s]  who will not only have the ability to make sure
[1180.64s -> 1183.92s]  that all children are where they need to be.
[1183.92s -> 1188.52s]  This possible reduction is extremely short-sighted.
[1188.52s -> 1190.32s]  If anything, we should be allocating
[1190.32s -> 1192.56s]  as many resources as possible
[1192.56s -> 1195.88s]  into the schools that make sure these kids don't fail.
[1195.88s -> 1198.48s]  Because if we aren't prepared when they come back,
[1198.48s -> 1201.60s]  this will not be a one-year issue.
[1201.60s -> 1205.24s]  It will go on and on for years and years.
[1205.24s -> 1208.44s]  And I'm not just talking about the kids who need intervention
[1208.44s -> 1209.44s]  and aren't getting it.
[1209.44s -> 1212.16s]  I'm talking about every single student
[1212.16s -> 1216.36s]  that receives an education from the Bethel Public School.
[1216.36s -> 1218.56s]  We cannot let these children down,
[1218.56s -> 1219.92s]  and because of that, I'm asking you
[1219.92s -> 1221.92s]  to leave the budget as is.
[1221.92s -> 1222.76s]  Thank you.
[1222.76s -> 1232.12s]  Oh, OK.
[1232.12s -> 1232.72s]  I'm sorry.
[1232.72s -> 1233.60s]  Jen Larson.
[1236.88s -> 1238.36s]  Yeah.
[1238.36s -> 1241.72s]  Jen Larson, 128 Gracie Plain Street.
[1241.72s -> 1245.32s]  I'm, again, not speaking as a Board of Education member.
[1245.32s -> 1247.80s]  I am speaking as a private citizen here in Bethel,
[1247.80s -> 1252.20s]  a educator and a parent of multiple children
[1252.20s -> 1254.96s]  who have been through the Bethel school system.
[1254.96s -> 1258.44s]  The Bethel schools have always done a phenomenal job
[1258.44s -> 1260.76s]  with the limited resources they've had.
[1260.76s -> 1265.12s]  They've made do and made do over and over and over again.
[1265.12s -> 1268.40s]  Our numbers of students have increased exponentially,
[1268.40s -> 1271.28s]  and they've still made do.
[1271.28s -> 1273.68s]  This can't go on forever.
[1273.68s -> 1278.56s]  And every year that we make do is actually like a cut
[1278.56s -> 1282.48s]  because you're giving us the same,
[1282.48s -> 1284.72s]  and we're doing more with it.
[1284.72s -> 1288.32s]  So therefore, it's not equal.
[1288.32s -> 1289.88s]  I know that things are hard.
[1289.88s -> 1291.84s]  I know that people are without jobs.
[1291.84s -> 1297.28s]  I understand the difficulty that the position that people are in.
[1297.28s -> 1302.60s]  I do, I have seen it, you know, with my neighbors, with friends,
[1302.60s -> 1305.36s]  with many people in town that they're suffering.
[1305.36s -> 1307.32s]  And I understand that.
[1307.32s -> 1312.00s]  What I'm asking you to do is to keep us at least a status quo budget
[1312.00s -> 1315.84s]  so that we can have exactly the same as we had this year
[1315.84s -> 1320.36s]  and be able to try to make do for one more year
[1320.36s -> 1323.76s]  in regards to the situation that we're in at this time,
[1323.76s -> 1326.72s]  being that we have to be cognizant of our neighbors
[1326.72s -> 1332.80s]  and their situation and that asking for more is a difficult thing.
[1332.80s -> 1336.76s]  But please don't make us do it less.
[1336.76s -> 1339.76s]  As Courtney said, our kids are coming back
[1339.76s -> 1341.68s]  and they're going to be at a deficit.
[1341.68s -> 1346.56s]  So by giving us a deficit, it makes it harder for us to catch up.
[1346.56s -> 1351.52s]  And that makes it extremely difficult for the educators,
[1351.52s -> 1354.92s]  for the parents, and for the students.
[1354.92s -> 1357.04s]  Parents are in way over their heads right now
[1357.04s -> 1361.16s]  and they're desperately seeking help from their teachers.
[1361.16s -> 1364.48s]  I know that I get daily calls from parents
[1364.48s -> 1368.00s]  who are desperate for me to help them in some way
[1368.00s -> 1370.00s]  with their child while they are home with them
[1370.00s -> 1372.96s]  and they're desperately waiting for school to start again.
[1372.96s -> 1376.20s]  And these children are coming to come back with needs,
[1376.20s -> 1378.84s]  needs from trauma that they've faced
[1378.84s -> 1381.00s]  over the time that they've been out,
[1381.00s -> 1384.76s]  losing family members, losing friends, neighbors.
[1385.84s -> 1389.68s]  Children are going to be in trauma from all of this.
[1389.68s -> 1392.40s]  And we need to be able to meet them
[1392.40s -> 1395.16s]  and help them get past that.
[1395.16s -> 1398.84s]  And we can't do that if you cut what we already even have.
[1398.84s -> 1401.64s]  And I'm not even asking for anything new.
[1401.64s -> 1404.72s]  So please keep in mind where we're coming from
[1404.72s -> 1407.92s]  and what we're going to face once we'll start again.
[1407.92s -> 1412.00s]  And keep that in mind when you're deciding what you feel
[1412.00s -> 1414.80s]  the town can afford to give.
[1414.80s -> 1417.16s]  So by asking for that status quo,
[1417.16s -> 1419.52s]  I think I'm just asking us to keep everything the same
[1419.52s -> 1423.32s]  as it is now and meet what we need to meet contractually
[1423.32s -> 1425.32s]  for all of our contracts.
[1425.32s -> 1426.96s]  Thank you.
[1426.96s -> 1427.80s]  Thank you, Jen.
[1429.64s -> 1432.00s]  In the comments section, there's been some people
[1432.00s -> 1437.00s]  that have asked me to write to add them to the comments.
[1437.44s -> 1440.68s]  You'll need to go over to the right hand side
[1440.68s -> 1443.60s]  of your screen where the participants are.
[1443.60s -> 1447.32s]  And at the bottom, there is the option
[1447.32s -> 1449.32s]  for you to raise your hand.
[1450.60s -> 1453.32s]  It's not something that I can do for you.
[1453.32s -> 1454.16s]  Okay?
[1454.16s -> 1457.04s]  So next person is Melanie O'Brien.
[1457.04s -> 1458.36s]  Hope one second.
[1459.80s -> 1461.04s]  I don't know why.
[1461.04s -> 1462.84s]  Let's give them the hard time.
[1462.84s -> 1463.68s]  Come here.
[1469.28s -> 1470.28s]  Okay, there you are.
[1470.28s -> 1471.12s]  I'm good.
[1471.12s -> 1471.96s]  Can you hear me?
[1471.96s -> 1472.80s]  Yes.
[1472.80s -> 1473.32s]  Okay, great.
[1474.32s -> 1477.32s]  Manfreda and all the Board of Finance members
[1477.32s -> 1480.12s]  in order to enter it into the public record,
[1480.12s -> 1482.48s]  I'm going to read a memo from me
[1482.48s -> 1484.40s]  as the chair of the Board of Education
[1484.40s -> 1486.04s]  and the memo from Dr. Carver
[1486.04s -> 1489.88s]  to the Board of Finance and Board of Selectment.
[1489.88s -> 1491.76s]  This information was previously provided
[1491.76s -> 1493.52s]  to the members of both boards,
[1493.52s -> 1495.60s]  but it's not included in the Board of Finance
[1495.60s -> 1498.28s]  meeting materials online.
[1498.28s -> 1499.56s]  It's not Wednesday.
[1499.56s -> 1500.96s]  Yes, I'm so sorry.
[1500.96s -> 1502.84s]  Will you just give me your address?
[1502.84s -> 1503.48s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[1503.48s -> 1506.08s]  Short 12 cross hill road.
[1506.08s -> 1507.80s]  Obviously, Bethel.
[1507.80s -> 1509.04s]  All right, thank you.
[1509.04s -> 1510.72s]  Thank you.
[1510.72s -> 1513.52s]  So this information was provided to board members,
[1513.52s -> 1516.52s]  but it is not online materials.
[1516.52s -> 1520.12s]  So I would direct you to the Bethel Public Schools website
[1520.12s -> 1522.68s]  under Board of Education 2020,
[1522.68s -> 1525.80s]  2021 education budget documents
[1525.80s -> 1527.76s]  and then you can see these materials.
[1528.76s -> 1533.36s]  The first memo reads as follows,
[1533.36s -> 1535.72s]  two Board of Selectment and Board of Finance
[1535.72s -> 1539.04s]  from Melanie O'Brien chair, Board of Education,
[1539.04s -> 1542.28s]  date April 10, 2020.
[1542.28s -> 1545.32s]  During the budget preparation and deliberation process,
[1545.32s -> 1547.48s]  the district presented a detailed picture
[1547.48s -> 1550.36s]  of the challenges faced by the growth and enrollment,
[1550.36s -> 1553.44s]  more students with needs requiring support systems,
[1553.44s -> 1555.68s]  and persistent social and emotional needs
[1555.68s -> 1558.00s]  of children throughout the district.
[1558.00s -> 1560.24s]  These are trends that are on the rise.
[1560.24s -> 1563.00s]  It is our responsibility as a school district
[1563.00s -> 1564.96s]  to address the academic, social,
[1564.96s -> 1567.80s]  and emotional needs of all of our children.
[1567.80s -> 1571.68s]  The consequences of COVID-19 includes social isolation,
[1571.68s -> 1573.56s]  distance learning from home,
[1573.56s -> 1576.88s]  and limiting traditional school offered supports.
[1576.88s -> 1579.84s]  It is anticipated that most children will be lagging behind
[1579.84s -> 1583.52s]  at the start of the 2020 school year as distance learning
[1583.52s -> 1584.92s]  is not classroom learning,
[1584.92s -> 1588.16s]  and family members are not professional educators.
[1588.16s -> 1590.08s]  Classroom teachers, interventionists,
[1590.08s -> 1593.44s]  and special education staff will have to bridge the gap
[1593.44s -> 1596.64s]  between distance learning proficiency at year end
[1596.64s -> 1598.48s]  and grade level expectations
[1598.48s -> 1601.08s]  at the start of the next school year.
[1601.08s -> 1604.48s]  Our most vulnerable children will be hit hardest.
[1604.48s -> 1606.92s]  Our strained resources will be further stretched
[1606.92s -> 1609.20s]  by the effects of COVID-19,
[1609.20s -> 1611.84s]  but we understand the economic uncertainty
[1611.84s -> 1615.20s]  and financial stress that many families are experiencing.
[1615.20s -> 1617.88s]  The board is cautioning against a major reaction
[1617.88s -> 1620.16s]  to cut the board of education budget.
[1620.16s -> 1622.48s]  History has shown us that there are lasting
[1622.48s -> 1626.40s]  and detrimental effects of understaffing administrators,
[1626.40s -> 1628.48s]  teachers, and support staff.
[1628.48s -> 1631.68s]  Dr. Harvard has put together the attached memorandum
[1631.68s -> 1634.16s]  to provide general information about the impact
[1634.16s -> 1638.68s]  of potential further reductions to the board of education budget.
[1638.68s -> 1640.52s]  The board has been and will continue
[1640.52s -> 1643.56s]  to be transparent about the demonstrated needs
[1643.56s -> 1647.36s]  of all of our children, as well as the budget drivers.
[1647.36s -> 1650.68s]  It is imperative that our town leaders and community
[1650.68s -> 1654.36s]  understand our resources, the growing needs of our children,
[1654.36s -> 1656.32s]  and the consequences of further reductions
[1656.32s -> 1657.76s]  in the education budget.
[1661.12s -> 1663.64s]  Dr. Carver's minimum is as follows.
[1663.64s -> 1666.68s]  To Bethel Seleckman and Board of Finance
[1666.68s -> 1669.88s]  from Dr. Christine Carver's superintendent of schools,
[1669.88s -> 1672.36s]  date April 10 to 2020,
[1672.36s -> 1676.68s]  regarding considerations for 2021 budget.
[1676.68s -> 1678.88s]  As you deliberate, we wanted to provide you
[1678.88s -> 1680.88s]  with the impact of any future reductions
[1680.88s -> 1683.60s]  to the board of education operating budget.
[1683.60s -> 1685.48s]  At our presentation, we already spoke
[1685.48s -> 1687.88s]  about the district theme and the crossroad.
[1687.88s -> 1689.44s]  While we know that there is real concern
[1689.44s -> 1691.32s]  about the status of the economy,
[1691.32s -> 1694.32s]  we caution you to recognize a long-term implication
[1694.32s -> 1696.44s]  of significant reductions.
[1696.44s -> 1698.84s]  In addition to all the significant challenges
[1698.84s -> 1701.12s]  we described in our budget presentation,
[1701.12s -> 1704.40s]  including increased enrollment, increased elementary class
[1704.40s -> 1707.88s]  size, open parent elementary classes
[1707.88s -> 1710.84s]  of 26 to 28 students, close parent,
[1710.84s -> 1714.28s]  more challenging demographics, which require more supports,
[1714.28s -> 1717.20s]  and the social emotional needs of all of our students,
[1717.20s -> 1719.96s]  the closure due to COVID-19 has added a new layer
[1719.96s -> 1723.36s]  to potential issues and its closures.
[1723.36s -> 1726.00s]  While the commenders staff are doing a phenomenal job
[1726.00s -> 1727.72s]  given the circumstances,
[1727.76s -> 1730.24s]  we anticipate that our students will have academic gaps
[1730.24s -> 1733.44s]  starting in the 2021 school year.
[1733.44s -> 1736.52s]  The virtual services we are providing do not equate
[1736.52s -> 1739.44s]  to the experiences we provide in a classroom.
[1739.44s -> 1743.00s]  We will have a challenge making up for these deficits.
[1743.00s -> 1745.24s]  Further reductions could have lasting impact
[1745.24s -> 1747.80s]  on the generation of children.
[1747.80s -> 1751.28s]  Education is an asset to the fiscal health of the community,
[1751.28s -> 1754.60s]  long-term implications of increased class sizes
[1754.60s -> 1757.92s]  failure to provide adequate intervention services
[1757.92s -> 1760.28s]  and stripping a webhead that come core programs
[1760.28s -> 1763.12s]  within our schools will deteriorate our system
[1763.12s -> 1766.08s]  and negatively impact our community.
[1766.08s -> 1770.32s]  We have dedicated staff who have always exceeded expectations.
[1770.32s -> 1772.12s]  They can work in surrounding communities
[1772.12s -> 1774.36s]  which provide better compensation.
[1774.36s -> 1777.16s]  They choose to stay with us because of our culture.
[1777.16s -> 1780.32s]  Reductions in staff and creating increased expectations
[1780.32s -> 1782.40s]  will affect morale and our culture,
[1782.44s -> 1784.28s]  which could drive teachers to look towards
[1784.28s -> 1785.88s]  more affluent districts.
[1785.88s -> 1788.60s]  This will exacerbate an already existing issue.
[1789.60s -> 1792.32s]  We were required by Governor Lamont's executive orders
[1792.32s -> 1795.64s]  to pay the majority of our contracts and labor expenses
[1795.64s -> 1797.64s]  despite our school closure.
[1797.64s -> 1799.52s]  Therefore, it will limit the potential
[1799.52s -> 1800.92s]  for the end of the year savings
[1800.92s -> 1803.96s]  that might have helped to mitigate this situation.
[1803.96s -> 1806.08s]  While we need the best of the circumstances,
[1806.08s -> 1809.08s]  we will not give up to replicate all of our services
[1809.08s -> 1810.92s]  for students with disabilities.
[1810.92s -> 1813.64s]  We likely will have to provide additional services
[1813.64s -> 1815.64s]  in the next school school year
[1815.64s -> 1817.76s]  as required by state and federal law.
[1818.68s -> 1821.96s]  Reductions will result in legoffs and loss of positions.
[1821.96s -> 1826.72s]  85.4% of our operating budget is salaries and benefits.
[1826.72s -> 1828.84s]  The district, like municipalities,
[1828.84s -> 1831.04s]  does not pay into unemployment.
[1831.04s -> 1833.76s]  Therefore, we would be required to pay up to 60%
[1833.76s -> 1835.76s]  of the unemployment expenses.
[1835.76s -> 1838.40s]  This would not only significantly impact the services
[1838.40s -> 1842.96s]  our students receive, but also perpetuate economic downturn.
[1842.96s -> 1845.08s]  We wanted to provide you with an idea
[1845.08s -> 1846.88s]  of what potential reductions could be
[1846.88s -> 1850.00s]  in terms of loss of positions and or layoffs.
[1850.00s -> 1853.44s]  We could not make any reductions in special education
[1853.44s -> 1856.00s]  as we are mandated by state and federal law
[1856.00s -> 1857.92s]  to provide those programs.
[1857.92s -> 1860.56s]  We have to provide transportation to our students,
[1860.56s -> 1863.64s]  St. Mary's, Non-Alog and Abbott Tech.
[1863.64s -> 1866.76s]  Between staff, special education and transportation,
[1866.80s -> 1869.36s]  there's not a lot of discretionary spending.
[1869.36s -> 1872.40s]  We wanted to provide you with a look at what the impact would be
[1872.40s -> 1874.68s]  if we have significant reductions.
[1874.68s -> 1877.32s]  The first chart provides an overview of the salaries
[1877.32s -> 1879.08s]  we are facing all assumptions on.
[1880.40s -> 1884.00s]  And there is a chart of cost salary benefits and total
[1884.00s -> 1886.56s]  for administrators, teachers, peer educators,
[1886.56s -> 1889.80s]  secretaries, 12 months, secretaries, 10 months,
[1889.80s -> 1892.04s]  nurses, custodians, and unaffiliated.
[1892.48s -> 1898.64s]  I am going to, I'm going to read this because I'm supposed
[1898.64s -> 1900.44s]  to be reading this into the record.
[1900.44s -> 1906.44s]  So administrators salary 125,400 benefits 21,000
[1906.88s -> 1911.88s]  for a total of 146.4 for teachers, 56,792
[1913.24s -> 1918.24s]  for salary benefits 21,000 for a total of 77,792.
[1919.24s -> 1924.24s]  Peer educators, a salary of 23,5 benefits 18,5 for a total of 42,000.
[1927.36s -> 1931.40s]  Secretary 12 months, a salary of 50,470,
[1931.40s -> 1936.00s]  21,000 in benefits for a total of 71,470.
[1936.00s -> 1939.96s]  Secretary 10 months, 35,900 salary,
[1939.96s -> 1944.96s]  21,000 benefits, 59,6, I'm sorry, 56,9 for a total.
[1945.80s -> 1951.80s]  For a nurse, salary of 59,454 benefits of 21,000
[1951.80s -> 1956.80s]  for a total of 80,454 custodian 55,665 benefits of 21,000
[1960.08s -> 1963.40s]  for a total of 76,655.
[1963.40s -> 1967.44s]  I'm affiliated 65,000 benefits of 21,000
[1967.44s -> 1969.16s]  for a total of 86,000.
[1970.08s -> 1972.36s]  This table provides you with an overview of the cuts
[1972.36s -> 1974.76s]  needed to get to a 3% increase
[1974.76s -> 1976.80s]  over last year's operating budget
[1978.00s -> 1980.64s]  and currently at 3.78%.
[1981.84s -> 1986.84s]  Sumeria 1 is to get the budget to 3%.
[1987.08s -> 1990.68s]  This would be five teachers,
[1990.68s -> 1994.88s]  a loss of five teachers or 9.5 paris
[1994.88s -> 1999.64s]  or a combination of five positions,
[1999.64s -> 2003.56s]  a combination of which would be administrator,
[2003.56s -> 2006.56s]  teacher, secretary, nurse, custodian, or unfiliated.
[2008.04s -> 2013.04s]  That would be a reduction of 390,000, I'm sorry, 391.870.
[2015.16s -> 2017.36s]  This next table provides you with an overview
[2017.36s -> 2020.04s]  of a 2% increase over last year's budget.
[2021.24s -> 2024.68s]  This is to get us to get the budget to 2%.
[2024.68s -> 2027.84s]  This would be 11 teachers
[2028.84s -> 2034.84s]  or 20 paris or a combination of positions
[2036.44s -> 2038.88s]  and the 12 combination of administrators,
[2038.88s -> 2040.80s]  teachers, secretaries, nurse, custodian,
[2040.80s -> 2042.20s]  or unfiliated.
[2042.20s -> 2047.20s]  That would be a reduction of 856,000, 025.
[2049.96s -> 2052.64s]  In the first table, if the Board of Education
[2052.64s -> 2055.40s]  chose not to add the specific four positions
[2055.40s -> 2057.00s]  proposed by the superintendent,
[2058.28s -> 2062.52s]  the one administrator, teacher, and custodian,
[2062.52s -> 2064.28s]  would be Alan H. Mashable.
[2066.44s -> 2068.80s]  The Zoom functionality does let us know
[2068.80s -> 2070.32s]  where that noise is coming from.
[2071.52s -> 2073.80s]  If you would like to maybe mute your phone
[2073.80s -> 2074.96s]  instead of being called out,
[2074.96s -> 2076.72s]  I would ask you to do that, please.
[2079.36s -> 2080.88s]  I think that's my dog.
[2083.00s -> 2084.56s]  So I just muted me.
[2087.92s -> 2088.68s]  Go ahead, Melanie.
[2088.68s -> 2089.68s]  Okay, all right.
[2091.16s -> 2092.84s]  So in that first table
[2092.84s -> 2095.80s]  and that was the information concerning
[2095.80s -> 2098.04s]  the getting the budget to 3%.
[2098.04s -> 2099.76s]  If the Board of Education chose not
[2099.76s -> 2102.40s]  to add the specific four positions proposed
[2102.40s -> 2103.60s]  by the superintendent,
[2104.68s -> 2106.76s]  the total of one administrator, two teachers
[2106.76s -> 2111.76s]  and one custodian would be 378,649.
[2111.96s -> 2115.92s]  To get to 3%, another 13,000, 221 would be needed
[2115.92s -> 2117.96s]  plus the steel unidentified previous
[2117.96s -> 2120.72s]  word of finance reduction of 30,000.
[2120.72s -> 2122.52s]  Would require that a peer professional
[2122.52s -> 2125.12s]  or equivalent salary also be eliminated.
[2125.12s -> 2129.72s]  So reducing the budget from 3.78% to 3%
[2129.72s -> 2133.04s]  would require a combination of five positions
[2133.04s -> 2134.88s]  as stated in the first table.
[2134.88s -> 2136.64s]  The actual productions of positions
[2136.64s -> 2138.52s]  would be decided by the Board of Education
[2138.52s -> 2141.52s]  and administration as these four proposed positions
[2141.52s -> 2143.44s]  were considered critical to student achievement
[2143.44s -> 2144.76s]  and the strategic plan.
[2146.92s -> 2149.28s]  Potential impacts.
[2149.28s -> 2151.88s]  Limit course offerings at Bethel High School
[2151.88s -> 2154.56s]  put AP on rotational schedules,
[2154.56s -> 2157.32s]  larger class size, sister twerp wide,
[2157.32s -> 2160.44s]  cuts to electives, specials or enrichment programs
[2160.44s -> 2163.08s]  six through 12, eliminate core programs
[2163.08s -> 2165.20s]  which make this community unique.
[2165.20s -> 2167.60s]  Other options which would need to be considered
[2167.60s -> 2170.24s]  delaying capital projects for one year,
[2170.24s -> 2171.92s]  increasing pay to play,
[2171.92s -> 2174.72s]  consider fees for other extracurricular programs
[2174.72s -> 2177.28s]  that currently do not have a cost,
[2177.28s -> 2180.12s]  reduction in after school clubs, activities and programs
[2180.12s -> 2182.84s]  for example theater, and music, et cetera,
[2182.84s -> 2186.48s]  and reducing or limiting student enrollment
[2186.48s -> 2188.22s]  in non mandatory programs.
[2189.48s -> 2191.56s]  And that includes the memos.
[2191.56s -> 2192.40s]  Thank you.
[2199.24s -> 2204.64s]  All right, next up we have Megan Ossomonti.
[2204.64s -> 2207.20s]  I know I'm probably not saying that right.
[2207.20s -> 2208.68s]  There you go.
[2208.68s -> 2209.52s]  Very good.
[2212.32s -> 2213.16s]  Megan?
[2215.56s -> 2216.76s]  Megan?
[2216.76s -> 2219.52s]  Hi, we're having a really hard time hearing you.
[2221.64s -> 2223.16s]  A, A, B, R, B play.
[2223.16s -> 2224.00s]  Excuse me.
[2234.40s -> 2235.80s]  Megan, I'm sorry.
[2235.80s -> 2238.12s]  You're not coming in clearly.
[2238.12s -> 2240.28s]  I'm not coming in clearly.
[2240.28s -> 2241.28s]  Okay.
[2243.28s -> 2244.12s]  Good closure.
[2247.44s -> 2248.28s]  Yeah.
[2254.16s -> 2256.72s]  We just, we don't have a good connection.
[2256.72s -> 2257.80s]  I don't know why.
[2259.28s -> 2260.28s]  Okay.
[2261.76s -> 2265.52s]  I also want to go and see if it's just me.
[2265.52s -> 2269.40s]  You know what, Megan, at the, at the bottom
[2269.40s -> 2272.32s]  where it says, do you see where it says group chat?
[2273.88s -> 2277.24s]  On the right hand side where the participants are,
[2278.32s -> 2282.80s]  you would want to just type what your message is
[2282.80s -> 2284.28s]  and want me to read it in for you.
[2284.28s -> 2287.80s]  I'd be happy to do that since we're not able to hear you.
[2289.08s -> 2290.08s]  Okay.
[2292.52s -> 2294.32s]  Just trying to give you an option.
[2295.28s -> 2296.28s]  Thank you.
[2300.80s -> 2303.52s]  Is that what you, would you want to try that?
[2303.52s -> 2305.00s]  Yeah, I give it all day though.
[2305.00s -> 2306.84s]  I don't know why it's not working, but.
[2306.84s -> 2311.12s]  Wait, now, now I just heard you a little bit better there.
[2313.80s -> 2315.60s]  Should I give it a go for it?
[2315.60s -> 2316.40s]  Yeah.
[2316.40s -> 2317.56s]  Why don't you go for it?
[2317.56s -> 2318.40s]  Is that okay, Bob?
[2319.24s -> 2321.64s]  Yeah, it was coming through pretty clearly at the end there.
[2321.64s -> 2322.64s]  Yeah.
[2322.64s -> 2324.04s]  Yeah, I can lie.
[2324.04s -> 2326.24s]  I feel like people are in here.
[2326.24s -> 2330.16s]  Um, so I think you're another district.
[2330.16s -> 2333.32s]  And I've received a full grader and a.
[2334.48s -> 2338.52s]  Do you spend one day, um, a seventh grader and a fourth grader?
[2338.52s -> 2341.72s]  Um, they are seeing what I believe in the making of the
[2342.16s -> 2346.84s]  education and I'd like the board to make sure that you keep any
[2346.84s -> 2350.44s]  budget cuts or any considerations far away from the classroom that
[2350.44s -> 2353.32s]  have to be building maintenance, things like that.
[2353.32s -> 2355.48s]  But it should stay away from the kids and the teachers.
[2357.52s -> 2360.32s]  Okay, Megan, I just want to make sure that I just heard what you said.
[2360.32s -> 2363.40s]  You're, you are in support of the school budget.
[2363.40s -> 2365.12s]  That's where your mind focuses.
[2365.48s -> 2366.48s]  Yeah.
[2366.48s -> 2367.08s]  Okay.
[2367.08s -> 2367.68s]  And I'm sorry.
[2367.68s -> 2369.76s]  Can you just tell me what your address is?
[2370.76s -> 2371.76s]  Edie.
[2373.76s -> 2375.76s]  Gracie playing.
[2375.76s -> 2376.76s]  Okay.
[2376.76s -> 2377.76s]  All right.
[2377.76s -> 2378.76s]  Eddie, okay.
[2378.76s -> 2379.76s]  Thank you.
[2379.76s -> 2381.76s]  Thank you.
[2381.76s -> 2382.76s]  Okay.
[2382.76s -> 2384.76s]  So.
[2384.76s -> 2386.76s]  Are you okay with that, Bob?
[2386.76s -> 2387.76s]  Yes.
[2387.76s -> 2388.76s]  Thank you.
[2388.76s -> 2391.76s]  We're going to go to Lisa Linda Salotti.
[2395.76s -> 2396.76s]  Linda.
[2396.76s -> 2397.76s]  Hi.
[2397.76s -> 2398.76s]  Thank you.
[2398.76s -> 2399.76s]  Thank you.
[2399.76s -> 2400.76s]  Thank you.
[2400.76s -> 2401.76s]  Thank you.
[2401.76s -> 2402.76s]  Thank you.
[2402.76s -> 2403.76s]  Thank you.
[2403.76s -> 2404.76s]  Thank you.
[2404.76s -> 2409.76s]  I would just like to say I'm speaking not only as a parent, but as a
[2409.76s -> 2412.76s]  member of the school community.
[2412.76s -> 2416.76s]  I teach at Johnson School.
[2416.76s -> 2422.76s]  And unfortunately, I totally understand how many people are struggling.
[2422.76s -> 2426.76s]  But unfortunately, the reality is.
[2426.76s -> 2430.76s]  The reality is that things are not going to be the same at Johnson
[2430.76s -> 2431.76s]  School next year.
[2431.76s -> 2435.76s]  We are going to be increasing by getting the third grade.
[2435.76s -> 2440.76s]  And to expect to keep the current services.
[2440.76s -> 2442.76s]  The same.
[2442.76s -> 2447.76s]  And have such a huge increase in the population.
[2447.76s -> 2450.76s]  And the students who have needs.
[2450.76s -> 2455.76s]  Coming to Johnson School next year, it is just impossible.
[2455.76s -> 2461.76s]  We are going to be able to do that without getting another administrator.
[2461.76s -> 2467.76s]  Our administrator right now is already overwhelmed with how much she has to do.
[2467.76s -> 2470.76s]  The class sizes day to day.
[2470.76s -> 2473.76s]  We have 28 kids in a classroom.
[2473.76s -> 2479.76s]  One student teacher who has a triad has up to almost 80 students.
[2479.76s -> 2484.76s]  And we really do pride ourselves on knowing our students.
[2484.76s -> 2491.76s]  And to do when you have 80 students, even 50 or more is a lot.
[2491.76s -> 2498.76s]  And we really do pride ourselves on helping every student get what he or she needs.
[2498.76s -> 2505.76s]  Very hard to do, especially going in behind the eight ball in the fall.
[2505.76s -> 2509.76s]  Because everyone's working really hard to try to help the kids now.
[2509.76s -> 2512.76s]  But as you've heard many times already.
[2512.76s -> 2518.76s]  And not the same as being present with them in person.
[2518.76s -> 2527.76s]  As it is over the past two years, specifically, we've seen such an increase in our school population.
[2527.76s -> 2533.76s]  Kids streaming in constantly throughout the school year into all of our schools.
[2533.76s -> 2536.76s]  All the building that's going on in town.
[2536.76s -> 2541.76s]  And the increase in how many school students are now attending in Bethel.
[2541.76s -> 2544.76s]  And it comes around us are decreasing.
[2544.76s -> 2545.76s]  We are not.
[2545.76s -> 2547.76s]  We are the complete opposite.
[2547.76s -> 2550.76s]  A lot of the population that's moving in.
[2550.76s -> 2555.76s]  They have special needs from in a lot of areas.
[2555.76s -> 2563.76s]  It concerns me greatly that it's going to be more than just those kids who are going to be struggling.
[2563.76s -> 2565.76s]  And we'll need the resources.
[2565.76s -> 2570.76s]  And it concerns me because already with 28 students in a class.
[2570.76s -> 2576.76s]  It's very hard for the teachers to meet the needs of every single student.
[2576.76s -> 2583.76s]  Though they work really hard to try.
[2583.76s -> 2594.76s]  I just feel like we cannot afford to lose any positions, especially the ones that are being requested for next year.
[2594.76s -> 2597.76s]  We really need those positions.
[2597.76s -> 2600.76s]  The job is to meet the needs of all of our students.
[2600.76s -> 2602.76s]  My question is how.
[2602.76s -> 2604.76s]  How do we do that?
[2604.76s -> 2606.76s]  If we reduce what we have.
[2606.76s -> 2607.76s]  How do we do that?
[2607.76s -> 2611.76s]  If we don't get what we need to address those kids.
[2611.76s -> 2614.76s]  I agree with the people who have already said.
[2614.76s -> 2618.76s]  Please keep it away from our kids.
[2618.76s -> 2621.76s]  No matter what's going on in society.
[2621.76s -> 2623.76s]  Our kids need us.
[2623.76s -> 2629.76s]  We want to make sure that we are there for what they need.
[2629.76s -> 2631.76s]  Right out of the gate.
[2631.76s -> 2638.76s]  Thank you.
[2638.76s -> 2640.76s]  Okay.
[2640.76s -> 2644.76s]  Next we have Mary LaCory.
[2644.76s -> 2647.76s]  Mary.
[2647.76s -> 2648.76s]  Okay.
[2648.76s -> 2649.76s]  Here you are.
[2650.76s -> 2652.76s]  I created this statement.
[2652.76s -> 2655.76s]  Mary, could you give me your address please?
[2655.76s -> 2658.76s]  Thank you.
[2658.76s -> 2664.76s]  I created this statement before COVID-19 turned our lives upside down.
[2664.76s -> 2667.76s]  I lived in Bethel for over 25 years.
[2667.76s -> 2670.76s]  I had two children graduate from the Bethel Public Schools.
[2670.76s -> 2674.76s]  I became a teacher in 2006 and taught in the district for almost 14 years.
[2674.76s -> 2678.76s]  Bethel was a different, better community than it was 15 years ago when I started teaching.
[2678.76s -> 2682.76s]  Diversity of all kinds makes us a more interesting and stronger community.
[2682.76s -> 2684.76s]  But it also comes with challenges.
[2684.76s -> 2687.76s]  Societal changes have led to less at home supervision.
[2687.76s -> 2692.76s]  Kids aren't spending time outside and families and neighborhoods don't know each other the way they use to.
[2692.76s -> 2695.76s]  Developments in technology can be beneficial in my classroom.
[2695.76s -> 2703.76s]  It also allows access to social media, violent video games and inappropriate content on various media that are affecting all of our children.
[2703.76s -> 2715.76s]  As a result, one of our most recent in-person faculty meeting was a workshop by the Women's Center to help us identify sexual harassment behavior by 9, 10, and 11 year olds.
[2715.76s -> 2728.76s]  The development last set survey of eight to 12th graders in the 2018-2019 survey is indicative of several concerning results, including students who have contemplated suicide nor anxious and depressed.
[2728.76s -> 2734.76s]  When shocking statistic is that only 16% of our students feel valued by our community.
[2734.76s -> 2737.76s]  This is our chance to change that.
[2737.76s -> 2740.76s]  One of the other side effects of Bethel's growth is class size.
[2740.76s -> 2744.76s]  When my kids were at Johnson, there were 22 students in their classes.
[2744.76s -> 2747.76s]  I currently have 27 kids in both of my classes.
[2747.76s -> 2751.76s]  I have to meet the needs of 54 individual students.
[2751.76s -> 2760.76s]  These students may be high achievers who need enrichment, English language learners, students with IEPs and 504s, free and reduced lunch, et cetera.
[2760.76s -> 2769.76s]  Bethel continues to implement a much more rigorous curriculum driven by Common Core Standards and GSS, et cetera, which continues to challenge our students and teachers.
[2769.76s -> 2774.76s]  The results of the developmental assets survey trickles down to 4th and 5th grade.
[2774.76s -> 2778.76s]  Social emotional and behavioral issues have increased significantly.
[2779.76s -> 2785.76s]  I have 5th graders who self-identify as having anxiety, depression and self-harm concerns.
[2785.76s -> 2793.76s]  I have participated in a 211 mobile crisis intervention with a student expressing suicidal ideations at 10 years old.
[2793.76s -> 2801.76s]  My major meeting this year was focused not on the students I was concerned about academically, but those with social emotional concerns that affect their academics.
[2801.76s -> 2810.76s]  It's very difficult for teachers to develop the type of interpersonal relationships that are required in our new society when we have 27 students in the classroom.
[2810.76s -> 2816.76s]  These increases in social emotional issues also lead to increases in classroom disruptions that affect the whole class.
[2816.76s -> 2820.76s]  Sometimes I need to address an issue immediately in the hallway impacting my instruction.
[2820.76s -> 2824.76s]  Sometimes PPS staff members call in to provide intervention services.
[2824.76s -> 2829.76s]  The last time we had this size enrollment, we had 15 more staff members in the district.
[2829.76s -> 2833.76s]  We must have more teachers to reduce class size at Johnson.
[2833.76s -> 2838.76s]  Our counselors, psychologists and social workers are overwhelmed.
[2838.76s -> 2841.76s]  Next year there will be three grades at Johnson and three grades at BMS.
[2841.76s -> 2847.76s]  BMS currently has three administrators and four secretaries, adding into a system principal at Johnson is a must.
[2847.76s -> 2863.76s]  Our school secretary located in the main office regularly has to deal with so many families and she's going to have 750 families that she's going to be the face of Johnson school and she needs to connect with those families.
[2863.76s -> 2867.76s]  So we must have an assistant principal at Johnson.
[2867.76s -> 2874.76s]  I implore you to follow the board of ed's recommendations and support the budget that is presented to ensure our future success as a district.
[2874.76s -> 2876.76s]  Thank you for your consideration.
[2876.76s -> 2879.76s]  Thank you.
[2879.76s -> 2882.76s]  Okay.
[2882.76s -> 2888.76s]  Next we have Nickerbocker.
[2888.76s -> 2890.76s]  Nope.
[2890.76s -> 2894.76s]  Oh, here we go. Sorry.
[2894.76s -> 2897.76s]  Thank you. Thank you. Good evening, good evening, everyone. Thank you for the opportunity.
[2897.76s -> 2903.76s]  I'm going to be brief. I have submitted a letter which you will find in the meeting materials that were posted online yesterday.
[2903.76s -> 2908.76s]  I just want to make a couple of comments and support first of the town side of the budget.
[2908.76s -> 2919.76s]  And I'm going to support both. I would like to see the budget that was previously voted on by the board of finance state intact and go to the public hearing, which will occur over the next few weeks.
[2919.76s -> 2926.76s]  And I well understand the fact that some people, some people are going to struggle through this crisis financially.
[2926.76s -> 2929.76s]  There's no doubt about that.
[2929.76s -> 2940.76s]  And I am all in favor of doing as much as we can to help those individuals through the different assistance programs that have been offered at different levels of government.
[2940.76s -> 2944.76s]  However, the town still has to pay its bills.
[2944.76s -> 2950.76s]  We've gone through three years in a row of having the town side of the budget be defeated on the first try.
[2950.76s -> 2956.76s]  And that has squeezed down farther and farther to the point where we have no place to cut.
[2956.76s -> 2959.76s]  And we are seeing substantial increases in work.
[2959.76s -> 2964.76s]  Let's give you a very brief idea over the past four years in building permits.
[2964.76s -> 2976.76s]  We've seen a 42% change in increase land use applications, 60% increase health applications and inspections 99% increase just since last year.
[2976.76s -> 2984.76s]  This is almost double higher marshal permits 21% police arrests up 44% in the last decade.
[2984.76s -> 2990.76s]  Now, none of those departments have had full time additional full time help in over a decade.
[2990.76s -> 2999.76s]  They get by with getting some part time help to do with a little bit of computer input that that can't happen any longer our town is growing.
[2999.76s -> 3009.76s]  And the workload is going up and every one of those departments that I mentioned is statutorily required to do their work in a certain amount of time.
[3009.76s -> 3012.76s]  They can't just say we'll get to it when we get to it.
[3012.76s -> 3015.76s]  And there's no such thing as doing more with less.
[3015.76s -> 3024.76s]  These are all jobs that require hours of field time inspections hours of pouring over engineering drawings and blueprints.
[3024.76s -> 3028.76s]  And there's no way to cut corners and they are up against the wall.
[3028.76s -> 3039.76s]  Last summer our building department was so far behind in inputting the building permits that they were issuing because remember they have to issue the permits within a certain amount of time.
[3039.76s -> 3042.76s]  They were three months behind in doing that.
[3042.76s -> 3045.76s]  And this is an untenable situation.
[3045.76s -> 3053.76s]  Now, the other factor is history has shown that in a crisis like this, the town's expenses go up not down.
[3053.76s -> 3062.76s]  Already we have spent thousands of dollars complying with the different requirements and responding to the COVID-19 crisis.
[3062.76s -> 3064.76s]  We've had to shift staff around.
[3064.76s -> 3071.76s]  We've had to buy new equipment to equip people to work remotely so they can we can comply with the governor's orders.
[3071.76s -> 3079.76s]  So at this point in time, all of our staff is working full time because none of the other things that they do have gone away.
[3079.76s -> 3087.76s]  I got an email the other day from a resident who said, well, now that everything is shut down, how much of the tax increase am I going to get?
[3087.76s -> 3100.76s]  The fact is we are seeing the same volume if not more already and there's already pent up demand, especially in the building trades and in land use that we're going to see as soon as the restrictions start to be lifted.
[3100.76s -> 3106.76s]  There is no savings from that and we will have higher expenses next year.
[3106.76s -> 3115.76s]  The health department is just one example has has that hundreds and hundreds of extra hours and have brought in extra people to respond to this.
[3115.76s -> 3117.76s]  We put in the COVID crisis line.
[3117.76s -> 3131.76s]  We've she's had to hire part-time people to help answer phones and Laura herself is working has been working seven days a week for the last six weeks as this thing started doing inspections and keep in mind all the normal stuff as I've said.
[3131.76s -> 3142.76s]  There goes on she still has to respond to complaints of dirty apartments, which is a health department issue she still has to inspect restaurants.
[3142.76s -> 3155.76s]  None of that goes away so I am asking this board of finance to please go forward the well crafted budget that you put together many weeks ago it was a height budget.
[3155.76s -> 3171.76s]  We had no frills there's no turf fields there's no extras it just covers the bill and that bill includes the debt load for fixing our schools the utility bills the payroll for our police department to keep people safe.
[3171.76s -> 3180.76s]  Those are the things that are in this budget as I've said many times our budget is not a political document it is a practical document.
[3180.76s -> 3187.76s]  That's what we need to pay the bills and provide the services that every one of you on this call expects to have from your town.
[3187.76s -> 3197.76s]  Now let me say a little bit about the school budget I'm in full support of that budget as well because I know from what my own grandchildren are going through with distance learning.
[3197.76s -> 3208.76s]  There will be many many more kids who are going to need extra help hopefully this summer we can put together a doctor cover can put together a summer school program that can help the kids who need extra help.
[3208.76s -> 3215.76s]  And then moving back in the fall there will be many more catch up days that our teachers are going to have to do.
[3215.76s -> 3229.76s]  So I implore you let's focus on the tax relief that can be offered the monetary relief that is offered to help taxpayers that don't got the pound's ability to provide the services that we need.
[3229.76s -> 3237.76s]  Thank you very much.
[3237.76s -> 3245.76s]  All right, so we have see shaffer.
[3245.76s -> 3256.76s]  Just give me your name and address.
[3256.76s -> 3266.76s]  Thank you very much.
[3266.76s -> 3274.76s]  Thank you very much.
[3274.76s -> 3281.76s]  Thank you very much.
[3281.76s -> 3298.76s]  I would like to ask that no cut image is the board of education budget because I'm seeing things now as an educator and the answer no circumstances.
[3298.76s -> 3307.76s]  I would not want any cuts to the budget because we have additional needs that we identify.
[3307.76s -> 3335.76s]  But now I'm seeing with my own students they're going to be delayed and they are going to need not just extra academic intervention when they get back in September.
[3335.76s -> 3353.76s]  But also emotional support and a lot of extra community and you can't do that with that.
[3353.76s -> 3373.76s]  So I feel that the budget we put in place for was addressing a lot of the increased needs and a lot of the increased population needs that we already had.
[3373.76s -> 3398.76s]  We just compounded this terrible thing that we're all going through and the kids are traumatized and they're feeling it and they're going to need a lot when we get back to school together.
[3398.76s -> 3409.76s]  I guess what I really want to highlight is that I know that people are struggling financially.
[3409.76s -> 3419.76s]  I definitely understand that my heart really goes back to everybody.
[3419.76s -> 3438.76s]  But there is a human cost. There is a cost to our children and our community if we still support that in the way that they need to be supported.
[3438.76s -> 3466.76s]  The teachers and the administrators and all of our professionals and people that work with our kids, you don't want either hand so that they can't provide the services that they need.
[3466.76s -> 3477.76s]  I like to say as you know, that all the questions, you know, can you wise and sound foolish.
[3477.76s -> 3487.76s]  If you cut now, the end result will be something that will continue on for not just this year.
[3487.76s -> 3492.76s]  It's harder and harder to catch it. The earlier you catch it, the easier it is to mitigate it.
[3492.76s -> 3502.76s]  And I think that we would be giving our students and our families and our community as a whole to cut this budget beyond what it is right now.
[3502.76s -> 3511.76s]  This is a budget that would serve the needs of our kids and it really can have any more cuts with that I'm having over the negative market. Thank you.
[3511.76s -> 3513.76s]  Thank you.
[3513.76s -> 3517.76s]  Okay, next we had Jen Lawler.
[3517.76s -> 3520.76s]  Thank you.
[3520.76s -> 3522.76s]  Here's what Dr.
[3522.76s -> 3525.76s]  Can you guys hear me?
[3525.76s -> 3527.76s]  Hi, Jen.
[3527.76s -> 3528.76s]  Yes.
[3528.76s -> 3529.76s]  You hear me, Dion?
[3529.76s -> 3530.76s]  Yes.
[3530.76s -> 3531.76s]  Okay.
[3531.76s -> 3534.76s]  Jen Lawler, 22 Beth Page Drive.
[3534.76s -> 3536.76s]  Jen, do you have your TD on?
[3536.76s -> 3539.76s]  I do not. I'm actually outside. It's not me.
[3539.76s -> 3540.76s]  Okay.
[3540.76s -> 3544.76s]  I'm sorry. Would you repeat your address or 22 Beth Page Drive?
[3544.76s -> 3547.76s]  Thank you.
[3548.76s -> 3552.76s]  So I'm not going to spend a lot of time repeating what's already been said.
[3552.76s -> 3557.76s]  I concur with a lot of it. I don't.
[3557.76s -> 3564.76s]  I want to point out a few things as the board of finance goes into their meeting to decide where the cuts may or may not come from.
[3564.76s -> 3566.76s]  Should they go down that road?
[3566.76s -> 3572.76s]  I am vehemently against any cuts that make the class size go up.
[3573.76s -> 3577.76s]  And the last four years I have seen it.
[3577.76s -> 3579.76s]  And I also see how much.
[3579.76s -> 3590.76s]  It affects children with the bigger class sizes as well as the teachers.
[3590.76s -> 3595.76s]  So I really hope that that's an area that can be left alone.
[3595.76s -> 3598.76s]  And I also just wanted to.
[3598.76s -> 3600.76s]  this as much time as possible.
[3600.76s -> 3603.36s]  I don't think that we should be pressuring our board
[3603.36s -> 3606.88s]  of finance to kind of build Roman a day here
[3606.88s -> 3607.72s]  with one meeting.
[3607.72s -> 3610.56s]  It's an awful lot to decide.
[3610.56s -> 3612.24s]  I don't know if that's already been discussed
[3612.24s -> 3613.44s]  that there'll be several meetings.
[3613.44s -> 3618.12s]  It may very well have been, but I think this needs a pause.
[3618.12s -> 3618.88s]  It needs time.
[3618.88s -> 3621.12s]  Everybody is exhausted.
[3621.12s -> 3624.00s]  Everybody is upside down emotionally, socially.
[3624.00s -> 3627.16s]  We've got all sorts of similar and different stressors
[3627.16s -> 3628.88s]  going on.
[3628.88s -> 3631.68s]  And I don't think it would be good for anybody
[3631.68s -> 3634.52s]  to rush into a decision.
[3634.52s -> 3640.40s]  And I also had told Matt, Nickerbocker, directly today,
[3640.40s -> 3644.36s]  I would like to see as much effort given as possible
[3644.36s -> 3647.52s]  to have enough time and place so that residents
[3647.52s -> 3648.68s]  have the right to vote.
[3648.68s -> 3653.04s]  I do not think that this should be decided upon without
[3653.04s -> 3655.24s]  there being a really, really, really serious reason
[3655.24s -> 3659.48s]  to have to go faster if it means that residents won't
[3659.48s -> 3661.20s]  get the opportunity to vote.
[3661.20s -> 3665.48s]  And yeah, I think that's it.
[3665.48s -> 3668.08s]  I'm very concerned about the class size, so though,
[3668.08s -> 3672.72s]  I definitely think, and I'm sorry, one more thing.
[3672.72s -> 3674.80s]  Mrs. Salerno is absolutely going to need help
[3674.80s -> 3675.60s]  at Johnson School.
[3675.60s -> 3680.16s]  That is not, I can tell you just from living it,
[3680.16s -> 3684.92s]  she's got a full load, and we have an entire school
[3684.92s -> 3687.16s]  grade coming into her building.
[3687.16s -> 3688.48s]  She's absolutely going to need help.
[3688.48s -> 3692.44s]  I don't pretend to know the answers on finding the funding
[3692.44s -> 3695.56s]  in an easy way, but that's a definite.
[3695.56s -> 3697.36s]  She's going to need some help.
[3697.36s -> 3699.68s]  So that'll do it.
[3699.68s -> 3700.16s]  Thank you.
[3703.16s -> 3704.32s]  OK.
[3704.32s -> 3705.52s]  Nicole Cruz.
[3708.64s -> 3710.16s]  Hi.
[3710.16s -> 3710.64s]  Nicole.
[3710.64s -> 3715.52s]  Hi, I'm Nidale.
[3715.52s -> 3719.24s]  I need for you to give me your address, please.
[3719.24s -> 3719.64s]  Sure.
[3719.64s -> 3722.80s]  My address is 1-4-4 Rockwell Road.
[3722.80s -> 3724.76s]  Thank you.
[3724.76s -> 3726.88s]  And I'm here just as a member of the community
[3726.88s -> 3730.72s]  and a mom with two parents in Bethel School,
[3730.72s -> 3736.04s]  so middle school and at Barry School.
[3736.04s -> 3738.96s]  We moved here to Bethel just four years ago,
[3738.96s -> 3741.48s]  and one of the main reasons why we came to Bethel
[3741.48s -> 3745.16s]  was because of the education system and the schools here.
[3745.16s -> 3747.72s]  And while I am extremely sympathetic
[3747.72s -> 3752.24s]  to the town's increase in costs due to COVID,
[3752.24s -> 3753.36s]  we're affected with it here.
[3753.36s -> 3756.48s]  My husband is not working.
[3756.48s -> 3758.20s]  I'm extremely sympathetic to that,
[3758.20s -> 3761.00s]  but in the same sense, my children here
[3761.00s -> 3763.56s]  need be aid at the schools.
[3763.56s -> 3765.24s]  Matt Nickabacher said it best when he said
[3765.24s -> 3766.96s]  this town is growing, and it is growing.
[3766.96s -> 3768.72s]  There are tons of younger families
[3768.72s -> 3771.08s]  with children moving into this town.
[3771.08s -> 3773.00s]  So the schools are becoming more populated,
[3773.00s -> 3775.68s]  and the teachers are having larger class sizes,
[3775.68s -> 3777.36s]  and there are a lot more children,
[3777.36s -> 3779.60s]  particularly in the younger schools,
[3779.60s -> 3783.16s]  that I notice a require one-on-one powers
[3783.16s -> 3785.96s]  and have IEPs and 504s, and we need the help
[3785.96s -> 3787.40s]  and our budget can't take the cuts,
[3787.40s -> 3791.32s]  because then we can't afford the appropriate staff
[3791.32s -> 3795.92s]  for these students who need these special services.
[3795.92s -> 3798.84s]  And we're constantly losing really good teachers
[3798.84s -> 3802.24s]  to neighboring communities who can afford to pay
[3802.24s -> 3804.56s]  their teachers what they deserve.
[3804.56s -> 3808.92s]  So just very quickly in support of leaving our budget
[3808.92s -> 3812.72s]  or the school budget alone, as is at the very least,
[3812.72s -> 3816.92s]  and keeping it kind of status quo, our kids need it.
[3816.92s -> 3821.68s]  Bethel does Bethel schools already do so much with so little,
[3821.68s -> 3824.84s]  and forcing them to take any additional cuts
[3824.84s -> 3828.08s]  really puts our kids' education,
[3828.08s -> 3830.20s]  a jeopardy here, and I don't think it's fair.
[3833.08s -> 3835.68s]  Okay, thank you, Nicole.
[3835.68s -> 3837.44s]  Thank you, Nicole, to you and your son.
[3839.56s -> 3842.60s]  All right, so next we have Karen Foster.
[3847.40s -> 3848.24s]  There we go.
[3851.60s -> 3852.44s]  Karen?
[3853.44s -> 3855.44s]  All right, can you hear me now?
[3855.44s -> 3857.44s]  Yes, Karen, what's your answer?
[3857.44s -> 3861.44s]  My address is nine, Burnham Wood Road.
[3861.44s -> 3863.44s]  I heard an earlier comment,
[3863.44s -> 3865.44s]  I think it was in one of the letters
[3865.44s -> 3867.44s]  about potentially cutting theater and music
[3867.44s -> 3869.44s]  to make up for other areas.
[3869.44s -> 3871.44s]  I just want to speak out against that,
[3871.44s -> 3875.44s]  because every kid in high school needs to find a place
[3875.44s -> 3877.44s]  and for a lot of kids.
[3877.44s -> 3880.44s]  Music and theater is a place.
[3881.44s -> 3883.44s]  So anyway, Bethel just won an award,
[3883.44s -> 3885.44s]  and you may have seen it on Facebook.
[3885.44s -> 3889.44s]  We were voted one of the 754 best communities
[3889.44s -> 3891.44s]  for music education in the country,
[3891.44s -> 3892.44s]  and that's a pretty big deal.
[3892.44s -> 3895.44s]  These are for communities
[3895.44s -> 3898.44s]  where recognition is outstanding efforts
[3898.44s -> 3900.44s]  by teachers and administrators, parents, students,
[3900.44s -> 3902.44s]  community leaders, hoping music education
[3902.44s -> 3904.44s]  is part of a well-rounded education,
[3904.44s -> 3905.44s]  and I just want to make sure
[3905.44s -> 3907.44s]  that we can continue to live up to that.
[3907.44s -> 3909.44s]  Music education, the theater program
[3909.44s -> 3911.44s]  is all very important to the kids,
[3911.44s -> 3914.44s]  and it deserves such attention as other areas.
[3914.44s -> 3916.44s]  I think that the music department is doing excellent jobs
[3916.44s -> 3917.44s]  with distance learning.
[3917.44s -> 3919.44s]  You may have seen the virtual choir concert
[3919.44s -> 3921.44s]  that was posted by Ms. Vanolo.
[3921.44s -> 3923.44s]  It was on several of the Facebook groups.
[3923.44s -> 3924.44s]  We haven't seen it.
[3924.44s -> 3925.44s]  Go to the Bethel Music Department page
[3925.44s -> 3926.44s]  and look that up.
[3926.44s -> 3927.44s]  It was amazing.
[3927.44s -> 3929.44s]  The music education
[3929.44s -> 3930.44s]  are continuing.
[3930.44s -> 3931.44s]  The kids are working.
[3931.44s -> 3933.44s]  I just want to speak out for keeping that
[3933.44s -> 3935.44s]  and recognize how important that is
[3935.44s -> 3937.44s]  and that Bethel has been given several awards
[3937.44s -> 3938.44s]  over the years for their music education.
[3938.44s -> 3940.44s]  I'd like to keep that standard up.
[3940.44s -> 3941.44s]  Thank you.
[3941.44s -> 3943.44s]  Thank you.
[3943.44s -> 3944.44s]  Thanks, Karen.
[3944.44s -> 3945.44s]  Okay.
[3945.44s -> 3949.44s]  Next, we have Rachel Karam.
[3949.44s -> 3952.44s]  Hi.
[3952.44s -> 3953.44s]  Rachel.
[3953.44s -> 3954.44s]  Hello.
[3954.44s -> 3955.44s]  Hi.
[3955.44s -> 3958.44s]  So, Rachel is your last name,
[3958.44s -> 3960.44s]  Karam C-A-R-A-M?
[3960.44s -> 3961.44s]  Yes.
[3961.44s -> 3962.44s]  Okay.
[3962.44s -> 3963.44s]  And your address.
[3963.44s -> 3965.44s]  149 Old Tullyville Road.
[3965.44s -> 3966.44s]  All right.
[3966.44s -> 3967.44s]  Thank you.
[3967.44s -> 3968.44s]  Thank you.
[3968.44s -> 3971.44s]  I just want to say that I'm speaking not only
[3971.44s -> 3973.44s]  as the Secretary of Johnson School,
[3973.44s -> 3976.44s]  but also as a mother of two children
[3976.44s -> 3979.44s]  in the Bethel Public Schools.
[3979.44s -> 3981.44s]  I can tell you that we have some of the best teachers
[3981.44s -> 3983.44s]  and administrators.
[3983.44s -> 3990.44s]  And I would love to see the education budget stay as is.
[3990.44s -> 3991.44s]  Okay.
[3991.44s -> 3992.44s]  Thank you.
[3992.44s -> 3994.44s]  Thank you.
[3995.44s -> 4000.44s]  And then next, we have Irene Drake.
[4000.44s -> 4001.44s]  Hi.
[4001.44s -> 4002.44s]  Good evening, everybody.
[4002.44s -> 4003.44s]  I want to thank the Board of Finance
[4003.44s -> 4005.44s]  for the opportunity to speak virtually tonight.
[4005.44s -> 4006.44s]  Irene.
[4006.44s -> 4007.44s]  Yes.
[4007.44s -> 4008.44s]  I'm sorry.
[4008.44s -> 4009.44s]  Your address.
[4009.44s -> 4010.44s]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[4010.44s -> 4012.44s]  My address is five pleasant rise.
[4012.44s -> 4013.44s]  Okay.
[4013.44s -> 4014.44s]  Thank you.
[4014.44s -> 4015.44s]  No problem.
[4015.44s -> 4017.44s]  So, I am a third grade teacher at Rockwell.
[4017.44s -> 4019.44s]  But I am speaking to my as a parents.
[4019.44s -> 4022.44s]  My daughter is currently a fourth grade student at Johnson School
[4022.44s -> 4025.44s]  and which is the BAS register.
[4025.44s -> 4027.44s]  I have an extremely large class size.
[4027.44s -> 4030.44s]  And research has shown that smaller class sizes is optimal
[4030.44s -> 4033.44s]  for the high quality student learning, both academic
[4033.44s -> 4034.44s]  and social emotional.
[4034.44s -> 4037.44s]  That Bethel is used to in our children deserve.
[4037.44s -> 4041.44s]  this cannot happen with any cuts to this budget.
[4041.44s -> 4044.44s]  The budget that was currently set when I went to the
[4044.44s -> 4048.44s]  Board of Finance meeting way back before COVID-19.
[4048.44s -> 4050.44s]  We might be able to do things then.
[4050.44s -> 4051.44s]  We cannot do it with further cut.
[4051.44s -> 4055.14s]  I urge you to think as elected officials,
[4056.18s -> 4057.46s]  not on the short term,
[4057.46s -> 4060.18s]  but about the long term negative effects cuts would have
[4060.18s -> 4062.38s]  on our current educational system,
[4062.38s -> 4065.10s]  especially given our current situation.
[4065.10s -> 4067.50s]  I sympathize with COVID-19 situations.
[4067.50s -> 4070.06s]  I have friends and family who have suffered,
[4070.06s -> 4072.34s]  so I am not without knowledge of that.
[4072.34s -> 4074.78s]  However, we know that our students will be returning
[4074.78s -> 4079.26s]  to school whenever the governor tells us we can come back,
[4079.26s -> 4081.52s]  we'll have significant gaps in their learning.
[4081.52s -> 4083.32s]  Distance learning does not replace the teacher,
[4083.32s -> 4085.44s]  does not replace the classroom.
[4085.44s -> 4088.60s]  These students that didn't normally require remediation
[4088.60s -> 4091.44s]  will now require remediation that we've never had
[4091.44s -> 4092.32s]  to do before.
[4093.32s -> 4096.28s]  So I just urge you to really keep the budget as is,
[4096.28s -> 4097.28s]  and send it forward.
[4097.28s -> 4099.96s]  And again, thank you for the opportunity.
[4099.96s -> 4100.80s]  Thank you.
[4102.92s -> 4105.28s]  Okay, next we have Jen Ackerman.
[4106.28s -> 4111.28s]  Jen Ackerman for Walnut Hill Road.
[4113.28s -> 4114.28s]  Thank you.
[4114.28s -> 4118.28s]  If my Wi-Fi is wonky, I need to know right away.
[4118.28s -> 4120.28s]  Just give me the high sign, I'll dart out.
[4120.28s -> 4121.28s]  Okay.
[4123.28s -> 4128.28s]  I really am concerned about maintaining all the proposed
[4128.28s -> 4131.28s]  positions that we have in the budget,
[4131.28s -> 4134.28s]  because really our needs have not changed.
[4134.28s -> 4138.28s]  I understand we are in a health crisis right now.
[4138.28s -> 4140.28s]  Many homes have been impacted financially.
[4140.28s -> 4142.28s]  Mine has as well.
[4142.28s -> 4146.28s]  But the school needs and our changing demographics
[4146.28s -> 4148.28s]  have not changed.
[4152.28s -> 4154.28s]  Oh, you cut out Jen.
[4161.28s -> 4162.28s]  Jen, you cut out.
[4165.28s -> 4166.28s]  We are...
[4168.28s -> 4170.28s]  Can you hear me?
[4170.28s -> 4171.28s]  You're back.
[4171.28s -> 4173.28s]  You're back.
[4173.28s -> 4175.28s]  Sorry, that would figure.
[4175.28s -> 4176.28s]  There you go.
[4176.28s -> 4177.28s]  There you go.
[4177.28s -> 4179.28s]  Hi, sorry.
[4179.28s -> 4183.28s]  Just basically re-prioritizing our artist resources
[4183.28s -> 4188.28s]  will not support our already overstretched teaching staff.
[4188.28s -> 4192.28s]  I think we have a moral and educational obligation to adjust to our new rapidly
[4192.28s -> 4194.28s]  changing demographics.
[4194.28s -> 4198.28s]  Or, you know, all students will be negatively impacted.
[4198.28s -> 4200.28s]  It's not really a choice.
[4200.28s -> 4205.28s]  We've started out with a negative teaching balance.
[4205.28s -> 4215.28s]  There we have a lot of on staff positions that we really need to get back
[4215.28s -> 4217.28s]  up and running.
[4217.28s -> 4219.28s]  We've been waiting.
[4220.28s -> 4225.28s]  Also, I just like to say like our goals to highly educate our children
[4225.28s -> 4228.28s]  and keep our community services running.
[4228.28s -> 4231.28s]  We are already squeezed.
[4231.28s -> 4233.28s]  And I just basically ask.
[4241.28s -> 4244.28s]  Can we've lost you again?
[4245.28s -> 4248.28s]  Oh, we just lost her.
[4248.28s -> 4250.28s]  She muted herself.
[4250.28s -> 4256.28s]  Deanna, how are you going to record Jen's ask?
[4256.28s -> 4257.28s]  I think...
[4257.28s -> 4265.28s]  Well, I have that she asked to maintain the budget and that the school needs have not changed.
[4265.28s -> 4272.28s]  All right.
[4272.28s -> 4278.28s]  Okay.
[4278.28s -> 4281.28s]  Next we have Nick.
[4281.28s -> 4284.28s]  I don't have a last name for Nick.
[4284.28s -> 4286.28s]  Hey, Nick.
[4286.28s -> 4289.28s]  Nick Hoffman, 163 plum trees road.
[4289.28s -> 4293.28s]  And I am speaking as a town busybody, not in my capacity as a board of
[4293.28s -> 4299.28s]  that member, charter, revision commission member.
[4299.28s -> 4303.28s]  And I support the budget as stated.
[4303.28s -> 4311.28s]  I think we risk a lot in terms of the future of our community by overreacting in this moment.
[4311.28s -> 4316.28s]  I think throughout the budget deliberation process, I've heard the term,
[4316.28s -> 4318.28s]  new share responsibility come up.
[4318.28s -> 4320.28s]  And now it's really to test that.
[4320.28s -> 4327.28s]  You know, unfortunately, as we presently sit, seven people bear the weight of the future of our community.
[4327.28s -> 4334.28s]  And I think fiduciary responsibility is at the core of what should be your decision making process.
[4334.28s -> 4339.28s]  fiduciary responsibility is outlined by a simple measure.
[4339.28s -> 4342.28s]  And the measure is the reasonable person standard.
[4342.28s -> 4346.28s]  And it's based on three duties, the duty of loyalty.
[4346.28s -> 4350.28s]  Which essentially means members put the interest of the town above their own.
[4350.28s -> 4354.28s]  That they're not there as advocates or members of a political party.
[4354.28s -> 4358.28s]  The DTA or breakfast or lunch club.
[4358.28s -> 4362.28s]  They're there to best serve the collective whole.
[4362.28s -> 4367.28s]  The duty of care that members come as informed advocates for the town.
[4367.28s -> 4371.28s]  They understand our finances. They understand the different components.
[4371.28s -> 4375.28s]  We can leverage to the benefit of our community at this moment.
[4375.28s -> 4378.28s]  And obedience.
[4378.28s -> 4383.28s]  The members are obedient to the collective needs of our community.
[4383.28s -> 4386.28s]  And ultimately that's what this is about.
[4386.28s -> 4392.28s]  You know, every other government entity is looking at how do we stem off this.
[4392.28s -> 4398.28s]  This epidemic, this, this crisis that we're facing that we've never been tested.
[4398.28s -> 4404.28s]  Since this has happened, there's a quote Benjamin Franklin spoke that's just been resonating my air.
[4404.28s -> 4407.28s]  And it's failure to prepare is preparing to fail.
[4407.28s -> 4412.28s]  And I feel by cutting this budget is preparing to fail.
[4412.28s -> 4415.28s]  We have two schools on the construction.
[4415.28s -> 4418.28s]  That are going to be opened up this fall.
[4418.28s -> 4423.28s]  So we're going to cut our budget to our schools and potentially lay off teachers.
[4423.28s -> 4428.28s]  How will our bonding rating agencies look at the leadership of our town.
[4428.28s -> 4433.28s]  That we're going to open up to brand new schools with the rising student population.
[4433.28s -> 4437.28s]  And cut our teaching staff.
[4437.28s -> 4440.28s]  Our bond rating be cut.
[4440.28s -> 4446.28s]  The rate where we should be getting the best rates we possibly can get rise.
[4446.28s -> 4448.28s]  For neglect.
[4448.28s -> 4453.28s]  Similarly, if we look at our staffing for our police department.
[4453.28s -> 4462.28s]  We're understaffed by the ratios established by the FBI and by the communities within our state that are similar to us.
[4462.28s -> 4469.28s]  Last year, the state of Connecticut passed the bill for post-traumatic stress for first responders.
[4470.28s -> 4476.28s]  It's not news that the Bethel police department has been dealing with a lot over the last 12 months.
[4476.28s -> 4480.28s]  And to be honest, the five years previous to that.
[4480.28s -> 4482.28s]  Trauma doesn't leave a body.
[4482.28s -> 4488.28s]  It stays there until it's triggered again and makes somebody incapable of doing the responsibilities.
[4488.28s -> 4491.28s]  So knowing that and knowing what our police officers been through,
[4491.28s -> 4496.28s]  we're not even giving them the protection to ask for the help they need.
[4496.28s -> 4498.28s]  That's negligence.
[4498.28s -> 4502.28s]  It's negligence.
[4502.28s -> 4507.28s]  So as we move forward, I too think this should be vetted in the traditional way.
[4507.28s -> 4512.28s]  I think we should wait until we can put this the ballot vote.
[4512.28s -> 4522.28s]  I think we need to protect the budget as is and protect the momentum that Bethel has created over the last 15 years.
[4522.28s -> 4527.28s]  And that's a very much different community.
[4527.28s -> 4533.28s]  One of the trends we've been seeing within the schools as well as an in migration from westchester county.
[4533.28s -> 4547.28s]  You think the people that are sitting in their town homes that are going on six or seven weeks of quarantine are going to be looking for a nice rural community in Connecticut to move to.
[4547.28s -> 4552.88s]  we collapse our real estate budget. Seventy to seventy and a half percent of our grandlist is
[4553.68s -> 4560.96s]  real estate, individual homeowners. And I get the suffering. I've been unemployed since last
[4560.96s -> 4565.84s]  August. This is something my family's been dealing with for over a half of a year now.
[4568.56s -> 4572.56s]  Two years ago we invested in a brand new house because we love this town. It's where my wife grew
[4573.20s -> 4582.32s]  grew up, grew a mile before her. An increased our tax significantly. We got hit by the salt
[4582.88s -> 4585.44s]  but it doesn't matter. This is our community. We're invested here.
[4587.20s -> 4592.32s]  And we need to circle our wagons and we need to vote as individuals and we need to support our
[4592.32s -> 4601.76s]  community. That's what I have to share. Thanks. Thanks, Nick. And beyond just the moment for the
[4601.76s -> 4608.72s]  next speaker, Nick mentioned something that I think was talked about by two earlier speakers
[4608.72s -> 4616.32s]  and that is the the the waiting beyond the May 15 deadline that this board has been
[4616.32s -> 4623.28s]  been given. I believe that is a valid question. I would just ask people to pursue that with the
[4623.28s -> 4629.20s]  board of selectmen, but that's not the board of finances jurisdiction. We kind of have been given
[4629.20s -> 4636.24s]  a charge to do something by a certain date. We can't argue whether or not that date is appropriate.
[4636.24s -> 4642.56s]  We kind of have to be the the line soldier and get it done. So I would just encourage folks if
[4642.56s -> 4648.80s]  they have a genuine concern and I understand that genuine concern. I don't think anybody
[4649.52s -> 4656.08s]  on this board of finance is taking lightly the added responsibility here. So it is a very
[4656.08s -> 4662.00s]  serious responsibility. It is a genuine and legitimate concern. I would just encourage folks to
[4662.00s -> 4666.40s]  take it up with the board of selectmen. Now Matt, I see Matt and Paul and my guests as rich as
[4666.40s -> 4673.04s]  here somewhere as well. Look, now I know they'll welcome that to be. So it's important. I don't
[4673.04s -> 4678.24s]  want a short shrifted here. It's just unfortunate what the board of finance is not the we don't have
[4678.24s -> 4683.04s]  the authority to make the change. But thank you very much because those are again, it's a very
[4683.04s -> 4687.52s]  important point. And I think it does need to be fully that if folks have a genuine concern about it.
[4688.64s -> 4694.56s]  I'm sorry, Dionne, go ahead. No, and Bob, I just want to I also want to say something just in the
[4694.56s -> 4701.44s]  group chat, there was a question of whether the people participating in this was going to be able to
[4701.44s -> 4710.40s]  vote. And this is just a time for public comments. There will be no vote by the public. This is a regular
[4710.40s -> 4716.48s]  board of finance meeting. And this is your opportunity to make public comments in this meeting.
[4718.16s -> 4725.12s]  Most of them seems like all of them are going to be about the budget. But there will be no vote
[4725.92s -> 4738.24s]  by the public during this meeting. All right. Then we have Don. Hi, Don.
[4739.04s -> 4742.80s]  Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Hi, Don. How are you? Good.
[4745.04s -> 4750.80s]  Don, what's your address? It's a three old failed drive. Okay. Thank you.
[4752.96s -> 4759.52s]  Okay. I'm going to keep this short. Thank you, everyone. I just want to reiterate what everyone
[4759.52s -> 4767.20s]  else is saying. I do have a student in the high school. And I do believe that our class sizes are
[4768.00s -> 4774.72s]  way too big. There are a lot of children with social emotional issues before this happened. And
[4775.44s -> 4782.16s]  it's going to be really hard when the kids get back. So I would like to just say that I am in support
[4782.16s -> 4788.56s]  of the education budget. And please do not make any cuts. Thank you. Thank you, John.
[4789.28s -> 4798.16s]  Okay. Then we have sis iPad. iPad six. Hi there. Sorry about that.
[4799.04s -> 4806.16s]  Melissa Corona here. From point of view, Hill Road Extension. Melissa, will you spell your last name?
[4806.96s -> 4811.36s]  It's Corona. It's kind of hard to miss it. It's C-O-R-O-N-A.
[4812.16s -> 4819.92s]  And I'm sorry you said Cod Hill Fish Road. 14 Cod Fish Hill Road Extension.
[4820.56s -> 4825.44s]  Oh my goodness. Thank you so much. Oh, yes. Yes. It's a fun last name right now.
[4830.64s -> 4838.32s]  I would just like to, first of all, Bravo Nick. It was absolutely spot on.
[4839.20s -> 4848.96s]  I'm also not only a parent of a 10 and a 12 year old in the school systems. I grew up here. I am a
[4848.96s -> 4857.04s]  lifelong resident of this town. I'm also a business owner of 25 years. I chose to open up my business
[4857.04s -> 4863.52s]  here because I wanted to give back to my town. And yes, there's nothing worse than a hardship
[4864.00s -> 4872.96s]  of everything that we're going through. Financially speaking, it's hard for the kids. It's hard
[4872.96s -> 4880.24s]  watching this happen. And all I can ask is, yes, I was going to say pretty much Nick summed
[4880.24s -> 4885.76s]  up on everything that I just hope that we can do moving forward. I'd like to see the vote
[4886.40s -> 4892.56s]  wind on, obviously. And really hope moving forward that we can do what is right for this town.
[4892.56s -> 4898.00s]  Because also as a business owner, I watch everything struggle. And it's hard to watch everyone
[4898.00s -> 4904.48s]  moving into this town that the low income housing, all this stuff affects us. And watching
[4904.48s -> 4909.68s]  the school system suffer like this is very hard. So, I hope we can make it work. I hope we
[4909.68s -> 4914.00s]  push the vote off. And I hope that everything works out for our children. Thank you.
[4914.32s -> 4915.92s]  Thank you.
[4919.92s -> 4927.04s]  Okay. Any other details of the orange? Anybody else would like to make any public comments?
[4933.36s -> 4939.20s]  Okay. We have one more here. We have, it's a phone number. I'm going to unmute you.
[4940.16s -> 4949.36s]  9-1-4-5. It's Allison Soel. Hi. How are you? How are you? Good. 88 Taylor Road.
[4953.60s -> 4961.44s]  And I just want to reiterate a lot of what's already been said tonight. And I get it. I'm talking
[4961.44s -> 4966.80s]  to you tonight as someone who's not just a parent, but also unemployed as a result of all this.
[4967.76s -> 4972.24s]  But my commitment to my kids and the other kids in the community doesn't change just because of
[4972.24s -> 4977.36s]  that. And so, I just wanted to say that I really love to see this budget left as is.
[4978.32s -> 4982.32s]  So we can work toward meeting all the challenges that have already been discussed tonight for our
[4982.32s -> 4986.56s]  growing district. Thank you. And thank you. That's the opportunity for us to all speak tonight.
[4986.64s -> 4993.44s]  All right. So we have, um, thanks, Allison.
[4995.44s -> 4997.68s]  Hey, we have Sergio's iPhone.
[5001.28s -> 5010.16s]  Oh, yes. Hi. Yes. Hi. How are you? My name is Hugo Cruz. I live at 35 Spring Hill Lane.
[5010.16s -> 5022.48s]  In it. Will you spell your last night? Sure. It's Hugo, H-U-G-O, Cruz, C-R-U-G.
[5022.48s -> 5024.08s]  Okay. Thank you.
[5028.08s -> 5033.68s]  Good evening, everyone. I hope everyone's saying safe. Just again, just to agree,
[5034.64s -> 5041.68s]  I would like to keep the school budget as the same. And, you know, if we can balance it that way
[5041.68s -> 5046.24s]  that will be magnificent. Just to keep it short. Thank you very much and have a good night.
[5047.76s -> 5048.40s]  Thank you.
[5051.84s -> 5055.76s]  Okay. We have, um, Rob Jackson.
[5055.76s -> 5062.48s]  Hello, this is Rob Jackson. 26 deepwood drive.
[5067.20s -> 5070.64s]  I'd like to support the school budget. I think it's good the way it is.
[5072.56s -> 5078.00s]  I agree that I think this should be sent to a vote. We have to hit the pause button and allow
[5078.00s -> 5083.84s]  the town's people to decide on this budget. And although I know there's time constraints to get
[5083.84s -> 5091.12s]  the budget passed, I think the town's people need to decide this budget. I don't know if there's
[5091.12s -> 5096.80s]  a way to hear from the Board of Finance tonight at all on some of their opinions on how we can
[5096.80s -> 5104.24s]  reduce the budget, whether it's to put off paving for a year, put off things like expansion of
[5104.24s -> 5110.56s]  the dog park, additional police, or what areas they think we might be able to trim the budget.
[5110.56s -> 5116.96s]  And I know it's needed areas, but I just think that there's probably other areas where
[5116.96s -> 5121.76s]  we might be able to reduce this sum. And I know the governor's pushing for us to do this, but
[5122.48s -> 5126.24s]  I tend not to listen to him very much. Thank you.
[5127.36s -> 5131.92s]  And Rob, to be responsive to your question regarding whether or not there will be any suggestions
[5131.92s -> 5137.52s]  for cuts, depending on how long this goes, I do think we will be having some of those
[5137.52s -> 5143.68s]  discussions in a little while. We'll follow the agenda. We've got a couple of administrative
[5143.68s -> 5156.40s]  things to do, but then we'll get to that point. Okay, I have Hunt D with hand raised, but for some
[5156.40s -> 5164.96s]  reason, they're above Rob Jackson, so I don't know if I accidentally skipped you. Hunt D,
[5165.92s -> 5170.80s]  did you want to make a comment? Yes, please. You did skip me. That's okay now.
[5170.80s -> 5177.20s]  No, I'm so sorry. You guys are my neither. So hey, you go. I'm going to be able to see it.
[5177.20s -> 5182.08s]  Six weeks. So my name is David Hunt, 32 Spring Hill Lane.
[5184.40s -> 5189.36s]  Hey, I've been a lifelong resident. I'm a teacher here in town. I have two kids in the system.
[5189.36s -> 5199.04s]  I would hate to see the progress we've made even since I was a child go down. I just spent my
[5199.04s -> 5205.04s]  whole life here trying to make and help this place be the best it can be. So I'm voting in favor of
[5205.04s -> 5214.48s]  both budgets. I think it's important that we support the people in town here. And that's my statement.
[5215.44s -> 5224.16s]  Okay. Thank you so much. All right. Is there anybody else that would like to make a comment?
[5229.60s -> 5232.40s]  All right, Bob, I don't have anybody else with their hand raised.
[5233.44s -> 5239.20s]  You know, we're not about an hour and 30 minutes. If we were doing this in person right about now,
[5239.20s -> 5246.00s]  we take a five-minute break. How do folks? I've got a screen in front of me with a bunch of
[5246.00s -> 5254.24s]  faces to the extent people are okay with a five-minute break. I'm good either way.
[5255.28s -> 5261.36s]  Looks like most people are nodding. Let's take a five-minute break. How are you reading here?
[5261.36s -> 5268.08s]  Oh, oh, oh, Bob Legnard, are you wanting to raise your hand? Yeah.
[5268.96s -> 5275.92s]  Okay. Well, I tell you what, I hear you. So why don't you go ahead and make your comments, sir?
[5277.52s -> 5285.20s]  You can hear me. I'm in favor of moving this forward and getting a budget in place. So when we
[5285.20s -> 5293.20s]  come out of this... Fuck you. Well, we're in right now that we could move forward with the town
[5293.20s -> 5298.64s]  the way we need to move forward. If we put it off, we put it off. It's like you're gonna can down the road.
[5300.32s -> 5304.88s]  They've identified things that are a problem. They've identified things that need to be done. We know
[5304.88s -> 5311.28s]  what we need to run schools. We know what we need to pay roads. And I think it'd be irresponsible
[5311.28s -> 5317.36s]  not to have a budget in place when we come out of this thing and go forward. Thank you.
[5318.56s -> 5324.80s]  Okay. And Mr. Legnard, what's your address? 11 Evergreen Drive. Bethel Connecticut. Thank you, sir.
[5326.08s -> 5333.60s]  I spent a lot of time here today. Yeah. Okay. With that said, is there anybody else that wants to
[5333.60s -> 5345.68s]  make a comment? Okay. All right. My computer's got us at 833. Let's see if we can be back here at 838.
[5347.20s -> 5354.56s]  Five minute recess. Okay. Thank you. I don't have music and I'm not gonna sing for you.
[5354.56s -> 5364.64s]  Yeah. So, D. Yes. Lead meeting. Does that mean? Is that what I hit? Or do I just walk away from my screen?
[5367.84s -> 5373.60s]  Why don't you just walk away from your screen? This is, this is unprecedented. I don't know if you can stop the video.
[5374.24s -> 5378.16s]  Don't leave the meeting. There's you have to go to get back in. Then you all have to log back on.
[5378.72s -> 5383.92s]  Oh, I need just hit your video off. Just on the bottom. Just like you do your mute your mic.
[5383.92s -> 5387.52s]  Just turn off your video too. That dude, I'll take your camera with you.
[5389.92s -> 5396.32s]  There we go. That's okay. Oh, but I can still hear you. So mute yourself.
[5396.32s -> 5399.12s]  No, mute me too. Yeah. Don't embarrass yourself.
[5473.92s -> 5475.92s]  You
[5503.92s -> 5506.72s]  You
[5533.92s -> 5535.92s]  You
[5563.92s -> 5566.72s]  You
[5593.92s -> 5595.92s]  You
[5597.92s -> 5599.92s]  You
[5599.92s -> 5601.92s]  You
[5601.92s -> 5603.92s]  You
[5603.92s -> 5605.92s]  You
[5605.92s -> 5607.92s]  You
[5607.92s -> 5609.92s]  You
[5609.92s -> 5611.92s]  You
[5611.92s -> 5613.92s]  You
[5613.92s -> 5615.92s]  You
[5615.92s -> 5617.92s]  You
[5617.92s -> 5619.92s]  You
[5619.92s -> 5621.92s]  You
[5621.92s -> 5623.92s]  If we can, okay.
[5629.92s -> 5631.92s]  You
[5631.92s -> 5633.92s]  You
[5633.92s -> 5635.92s]  You
[5635.92s -> 5637.92s]  You
[5637.92s -> 5639.92s]  You
[5639.92s -> 5641.92s]  You
[5641.92s -> 5643.92s]  You
[5643.92s -> 5647.92s]  You
[5651.92s -> 5653.92s]  And I've got
[5653.92s -> 5654.92s]  38. I just give people another minute or two.
[5654.92s -> 5657.92s]  Nope. I mean if you if you want to go, let's go.
[5657.92s -> 5666.56s]  I do, I would like to say, if we are able to see any background noise, where it might
[5666.56s -> 5673.76s]  be coming from, so there are some of you that I am muting, and I'm muting you just because
[5673.76s -> 5680.32s]  we can hear you. So if you are muted, please stay that way. Don't unmute yourself.
[5680.32s -> 5691.60s]  I see Brian, I see Robert. You're just doing a check of the board of finance.
[5695.60s -> 5706.16s]  I see Dee, Cynthia, and don't be Nick or Wendy. Who farted? He's mad.
[5710.88s -> 5718.48s]  You farted. Okay, let's see. Cut that guy out. Did you fart?
[5721.36s -> 5722.56s]  Did you fart it, didn't you?
[5732.72s -> 5735.28s]  We have adults here, please. Thank you.
[5740.32s -> 5748.56s]  Someone farted.
[5752.16s -> 5753.36s]  You manage that, Dee, vote.
[5763.76s -> 5764.88s]  I see you. Let him know.
[5771.28s -> 5775.52s]  Okay, Wendy, are you back?
[5778.96s -> 5779.68s]  Wendy is.
[5781.68s -> 5783.04s]  Can you go in my right?
[5784.80s -> 5789.12s]  Yeah, we hear you. Deon, you've got all the board of finance members unmuted.
[5789.12s -> 5793.76s]  No, I am trying my best right now. Give me just one second.
[5794.56s -> 5795.84s]  Looks like Nick is in now.
[5800.56s -> 5804.16s]  Let me see who am I missing?
[5804.80s -> 5806.24s]  Cynthia is still muted.
[5806.24s -> 5808.56s]  Okay, can we just one second?
[5808.56s -> 5809.68s]  Yes, still muted.
[5813.44s -> 5815.04s]  Hey, I'm working on it guys.
[5816.24s -> 5816.80s]  Thank you.
[5818.48s -> 5821.68s]  Great job for the first time through. You're doing a great job for this.
[5824.24s -> 5826.00s]  This is a little crazy, but it's all good.
[5830.56s -> 5836.88s]  Is that, and then let's unmute.
[5837.68s -> 5841.52s]  Okay, here, do I have everybody now?
[5843.52s -> 5844.72s]  Looks like we got everyone.
[5844.72s -> 5849.12s]  Okay, going down the agenda, the next item is corresponding.
[5850.08s -> 5851.60s]  You know what, I do, I'm sorry.
[5851.60s -> 5852.80s]  I don't mean to interrupt you.
[5852.80s -> 5853.60s]  I apologize.
[5853.60s -> 5857.44s]  I need to unmute Bob Kelslowski.
[5857.44s -> 5860.80s]  There he is.
[5862.64s -> 5863.28s]  There we go.
[5863.28s -> 5863.84s]  Hey, Bob.
[5866.48s -> 5868.00s]  Okay, I think we're good now.
[5869.12s -> 5870.56s]  Okay, sorry about that, Bob.
[5870.56s -> 5873.60s]  Oh, it's actually, the agenda item is corresponding.
[5873.60s -> 5876.88s]  Do we have any additional respondents?
[5878.64s -> 5879.60s]  No, no.
[5880.48s -> 5882.24s]  Moving on to the next agenda item.
[5882.24s -> 5886.72s]  Consideration of approval of the regular meeting minutes from March 10.
[5887.76s -> 5891.52s]  Those were distributed to give folks just a minute to go through those.
[5901.52s -> 5906.24s]  And it's an emotion to accept the minutes as submitted.
[5906.88s -> 5907.28s]  Second.
[5910.64s -> 5911.28s]  Discussion.
[5913.36s -> 5915.44s]  All those in favor, please signify by saying aye.
[5915.92s -> 5916.40s]  Aye.
[5916.40s -> 5916.72s]  Aye.
[5918.72s -> 5921.68s]  Okay, um, comptroller's report.
[5923.04s -> 5927.12s]  Again, I think everybody had the comptroller's report or the comptroller's report was
[5927.12s -> 5929.52s]  attached to the meeting invite.
[5929.52s -> 5932.80s]  So Bob will turn it over to you for the comptroller's report.
[5932.80s -> 5934.48s]  Okay, just just real quickly.
[5935.12s -> 5937.12s]  So we can move on to the rest of the agenda.
[5938.48s -> 5941.52s]  Looking at the report, there's a few items I wanted to bring up.
[5942.32s -> 5949.04s]  Account 405, uh, paramedic, which is in the mental service department.
[5949.04s -> 5952.40s]  The paramedic, you'll see a large number in that.
[5952.40s -> 5956.96s]  The dollars haven't been transferred over to the paramedic account at this point.
[5956.96s -> 5958.72s]  It will be before the end of the year.
[5958.72s -> 5960.32s]  You always do that to the end of the year.
[5961.12s -> 5966.40s]  In account, 290 emergency management, just like the last one, I mentioned it.
[5966.40s -> 5969.60s]  Of course, the tower is in there, so the office expense is
[5970.32s -> 5978.64s]  overstated or we overspent on that, but that's a tower on Spring Hill and it's an agreement we had
[5982.08s -> 5985.04s]  worked up after the budget was prepared last year.
[5985.04s -> 5988.24s]  So we're going to overrun that particular item.
[5989.12s -> 5995.20s]  In account, 200 social services, you'll see that the 20,000 so far has not been distributed to
[5996.00s -> 5998.00s]  the different organizations.
[5998.00s -> 6000.32s]  That too at the end of the year is normally done.
[6000.32s -> 6004.80s]  So within the next month or so, we'll start to sit down with some
[6006.40s -> 6011.68s]  social service director and decide how the 20,000 will be distributed.
[6013.52s -> 6017.04s]  And then the probate court, just like I mentioned the last couple of months, we're part of
[6018.00s -> 6027.20s]  the town's Bethel, Newtown, Reading and Richery, and so you'll see not over payment, but
[6028.40s -> 6034.00s]  additional expenses in there, but we built out at the end of the year and we're in line with
[6034.64s -> 6037.04s]  the numbers that we should have by the end of the year.
[6037.52s -> 6041.20s]  All that in that, all the other accounts pretty much seem to be in order.
[6044.00s -> 6044.48s]  Thank you.
[6045.44s -> 6047.52s]  Any any questions for Bob?
[6048.32s -> 6049.28s]  I have a question.
[6053.20s -> 6054.32s]  You're good. Keep talking.
[6055.28s -> 6058.48s]  I just want to yeah, I would just if you if you don't want to raise your hand,
[6058.48s -> 6062.16s]  if you will at least just say, you know, Wendy has a question.
[6062.16s -> 6065.68s]  Just state your name just so that I know who's talking.
[6067.52s -> 6072.16s]  Okay, okay, so I can speak now.
[6072.64s -> 6073.04s]  Yes.
[6075.04s -> 6077.04s]  I have one to ask me that before.
[6077.04s -> 6077.44s]  Wow.
[6079.44s -> 6083.04s]  So permission before that's funny.
[6084.08s -> 6093.68s]  So Bob, do you see any, do you have an approximate idea, any kind of feeling for where we're going
[6093.68s -> 6095.12s]  to end the year?
[6096.96s -> 6101.60s]  I know it's a little early, yeah it's early, I don't think we're going to be far
[6101.60s -> 6107.28s]  off from what we had in the last couple of years. But since you brought that up, I do have
[6107.28s -> 6111.92s]  and it relates to what we're going to talk about later on. Savings and additional costs of
[6111.92s -> 6118.24s]  revenue loss because of COVID-19, you know, some of the departments and asking the department
[6118.24s -> 6125.44s]  heads for their input. In the highway department, we're looking at probably at numbers like
[6125.44s -> 6135.04s]  $83,654 in savings, Park and Rec, $63,700, the senior set and $6,000. That totals up to about
[6135.04s -> 6144.40s]  $153,000, $153,400. But if you look at the other side, the loss revenue or the additional
[6144.40s -> 6151.36s]  costs in highway, which also includes the transfer station, we're not receiving any revenue
[6151.36s -> 6157.60s]  for the garbage that we're collecting at this point. We just paying to, for the residents that drop
[6157.60s -> 6162.40s]  off their garbage, we're paying to dispose of it. And that cost is about $3,000 a month, so that's
[6162.40s -> 6171.68s]  about $12,000. In Park and Rec, our part of the $63,000 savings was the before and after the
[6171.68s -> 6180.08s]  school program. We're going to lose revenue to the extent of about $82,000. So in that department
[6180.08s -> 6184.32s]  alone, because they have to buy, they're at a focal point right now for all the supplies that we're
[6184.32s -> 6191.04s]  buying for the COVID-19. So far, I've bought about $3,600,000 in support of the next
[6192.32s -> 6198.32s]  of lights and that sort of item. The senior Senate, because they're not running the programs and
[6198.32s -> 6206.56s]  saving $6,000. But what they're losing in revenue is about $12,850. And then in the town clerks
[6206.56s -> 6211.60s]  department, because we're going to have increased costs for the primary ballots, they all have to be
[6211.60s -> 6219.36s]  mailed out to the registered voters, there's going to be about a $300 course there. And emergency
[6219.36s -> 6225.28s]  management, right now, someone mentioned before, I think it was Matt, mentioned about the laptops
[6225.28s -> 6232.96s]  that we have to purchase. They were $6,300. The PPE was $3,700. The Zoom that we're on right now,
[6232.96s -> 6239.68s]  $132. That's something we never had before. So that totals up to $10,175 for a grant total
[6239.68s -> 6246.00s]  of $127,500. And when you compare that with the savings from the other departments I spoke about
[6246.00s -> 6254.24s]  before, the next savings at this point is about $26,000, $25,000, $854. So maybe that answers your question.
[6255.20s -> 6266.72s]  Yeah, I'm done. Can I ask Bob a question? Bob, some of those COVID-19 costs, though,
[6266.72s -> 6271.12s]  are going to be reimbursed most likely through the federal government, correct?
[6271.12s -> 6276.64s]  Yeah, they probably will. I think right now to look at either 70 or 80% reimbursement,
[6276.64s -> 6282.72s]  but that's not going to come in right away. It's probably going to be a good year based on our
[6282.72s -> 6288.48s]  prior experience with FEMA and the federal government. And I mean, you're going to get some
[6288.48s -> 6295.44s]  reimbursement. And kind of says one question. They won't reimburse us for the most revenue on
[6295.44s -> 6301.52s]  like the parking wreck programs, you know, substantial. When I looked at utilities,
[6303.12s -> 6312.08s]  it looks like we spend about on average $189,000 a month on utilities. And when I kind of looked
[6312.08s -> 6318.00s]  over it, it looked like we'd have probably a little over $100,000 in savings in the utility
[6318.00s -> 6324.40s]  account. Do you agree with that? And that's probably an ample clock. Some of it may have to get
[6324.40s -> 6331.12s]  allocator over to the utility department of water and sewer. We do, we do those adjustments
[6331.12s -> 6338.40s]  so as the end of the year, but we'll probably have a surplus in the utility department. Maybe
[6338.88s -> 6341.12s]  but we'll have something. All right. Thank you.
[6342.80s -> 6349.52s]  Hey, Bob. Yep. I just want to make a comment to Brian's question. The FEMA reimbursement rate is
[6349.52s -> 6356.64s]  75% but we have yet to be told what exactly is covered. And those costs typically don't come
[6356.64s -> 6361.20s]  in for a body on sometimes up to a year. So just wanted to make you aware of that.
[6361.20s -> 6371.68s]  Bob, I'm curious as to how the fourth quarter, I know it's early, right? The fourth quarter revenue
[6372.80s -> 6378.56s]  collections have been tracking. Do you have any insight into what that looks like?
[6379.60s -> 6384.08s]  I know talking to Anne, the tax collector, the money was coming in. They're pretty busy
[6384.08s -> 6389.68s]  with the drop box. And in fact, so much so that they're using people's bank, which we normally
[6389.76s -> 6396.72s]  use in the first quarter for the drop box. So she's sending down deposits for people's to process
[6396.72s -> 6405.76s]  for us. 54% of our money comes in on escrowed accounts. We've already received that for the fourth
[6405.76s -> 6412.88s]  quarter. 46% is non escrowed accounts. And that money seems to be coming in at this point. We
[6412.88s -> 6418.72s]  won't know for another week or two, which is almost the end of the day, April. How much
[6419.68s -> 6426.00s]  wind up collecting of that 46%? But, you know, her feeling is it's going to be, it's going to be
[6426.00s -> 6430.40s]  a substantial. I don't think we're going to have a shortfall, a major shortfall.
[6432.24s -> 6438.32s]  Trending more or less as we would normally see kind of pre I think so. I think so at this point.
[6442.64s -> 6444.88s]  Any more questions for Bob?
[6448.72s -> 6461.60s]  Oh, I'm sorry. Do we have any, because it was such a mild winter? Are there any,
[6462.56s -> 6464.88s]  is there any money left there, salt, sand?
[6466.40s -> 6471.44s]  There was some windy, but what he was going to do with that, and that's included in my number here,
[6472.16s -> 6478.56s]  what he was going to do is divert that within the same department to the catch base.
[6478.88s -> 6484.00s]  We have to do it because of the state requirement to clean the basins every two or three years,
[6484.00s -> 6490.48s]  all of them. So that was going to be done, but because you need two people in a truck and they're
[6490.48s -> 6498.96s]  only driving one at a time, that's put off until this COVID-19 virus is basically gone. You know,
[6498.96s -> 6504.72s]  so we're going to save 79,000 in that, which is represents the amount of money we saved on a
[6504.72s -> 6509.84s]  sand in the soil, but we're going to have to use that again in the first quarter next year to clean
[6509.84s -> 6519.04s]  those basins. They have to get cleaned. Okay. Cynthia has a question. Thanks. Yep. Okay.
[6520.64s -> 6525.68s]  So I saw the memo that went out asking the various departments to
[6526.64s -> 6534.08s]  report on any cost savings they could cite. And you just said a few, but the ones that I saw in
[6534.08s -> 6540.00s]  your memo didn't seem to have any. And I was just wondering if what we've just talked about is all
[6540.00s -> 6546.56s]  that there was in terms of savings. Yeah. I mean, these were all the departments that got back to me.
[6547.28s -> 6554.16s]  The final number probably around 530 just afternoon, which I incorporated into the schedule,
[6554.16s -> 6561.52s]  but yeah, it's all the departments that responded. Right. But even so, you just pointed out
[6561.52s -> 6569.76s]  the highway department and the utilities, which are, you know, they weren't included as a response.
[6569.76s -> 6575.92s]  And I'm just saying, are there anywhere that you've computed? Not from the departments,
[6575.92s -> 6579.68s]  but just from you knowing, are there any savings that you think we're going to come in
[6579.92s -> 6588.24s]  under as far as costs? No. Not at this point. No. I didn't come up with anything. Okay. Thank you.
[6592.56s -> 6597.60s]  Any other questions for Bob and this segment of the agenda?
[6599.36s -> 6602.24s]  Bob, are we going to come back to savings when we talk later?
[6602.72s -> 6608.48s]  We've got it here. Yeah. All right. Get it mild.
[6610.00s -> 6615.84s]  My only question would be, so are we expecting really not to have any money left over at the end
[6615.84s -> 6622.24s]  of the year? That would be transferred into the the general fund? The fund balance. No savings.
[6622.24s -> 6630.16s]  I think, you know, like we had last year, three, four hundred thousand, we may not have that type of
[6630.16s -> 6636.72s]  a number at this point, but we won't have some money going into the fund balance. Okay. Thank you.
[6639.60s -> 6644.16s]  Bob, I take it. I'm sorry, Nick. Are you going to say something? No, I'm going to
[6646.80s -> 6652.56s]  try to pay attention to the functionality of Zoom. It kind of gives the box of squares. It looks
[6652.56s -> 6657.84s]  like someone's trying to talk. So sorry, Nick, I thought you were trying to talk. Bob, so I guess
[6657.84s -> 6666.32s]  then what you're saying is the 300,000 or so that will be going into the general fund will be
[6666.32s -> 6675.44s]  primarily not from savings, but rather from our over our budgeting rate. Yeah. I think you
[6675.44s -> 6687.12s]  can say that like we had last year. I have a question and follow up on that, Bob.
[6688.64s -> 6694.16s]  Historically, where were we seeing that bulk of that might come from? You talked about
[6695.12s -> 6702.96s]  $26,000 worth of savings. I guess that was largely parks and rec. Where do we see the
[6703.60s -> 6709.20s]  additional funds coming from? Well, it could be from employee benefits because we have
[6710.16s -> 6719.36s]  contracted services. The unions have agreed to move to the partnership plan. So there are some
[6720.40s -> 6726.32s]  savings when we move to different medical plans. That would be the bulk of it really when it comes
[6726.32s -> 6734.64s]  in. You may have some money coming from utilities like Brian, I mentioned before. So there'll be
[6734.64s -> 6745.92s]  a couple of different areas. Okay. Okay, I guess kind of since we've recently adopted the practice of
[6747.84s -> 6753.84s]  accepting as submitted the comptroller before I guess. And in motion to accept the
[6753.84s -> 6761.92s]  council before as submitted. So moved. All second. Any discussion? All those in favor,
[6761.92s -> 6769.76s]  please signify by saying aye. Okay. So just so I can make sure that motion was made by Bob
[6769.76s -> 6775.92s]  on May 3rd. It was seconded by Robert Palmer. I think it was Robert Palmer made the motion.
[6776.00s -> 6780.72s]  And when you seconded it. When do you second? Yeah. Okay. I'm glad I asked.
[6784.16s -> 6790.32s]  All right. Now we come to the last agenda item which is consideration of the budget for
[6790.32s -> 6798.80s]  purposes of the public hearing. My guess is that the vast majority, the 115 participants on the
[6798.80s -> 6805.84s]  call are most interested in this part of the evening. What might be helpful is to give a brief
[6805.92s -> 6814.64s]  kind of summary of how we got here where we are and where we go from here to kind of put this
[6814.64s -> 6824.24s]  a little bit in context. Remember that we started this budget process with your intent that the
[6824.24s -> 6829.92s]  department heads who begin presenting their request to joint meetings of the Board of Selectman and
[6829.92s -> 6836.80s]  the Board of Finance. The boards and the department heads met for several nights over the next
[6836.80s -> 6845.12s]  month. Then on March 10, the Board of Finance voted 61 to send a proposal to the public
[6845.12s -> 6851.92s]  hearing for the purpose of getting public input before final deliberation on a budget.
[6852.72s -> 6859.76s]  That budget suggested an increase in spending of 3.495 percent
[6860.96s -> 6868.40s]  increased in the mill rate of 2.39 percent. That's the budget I believe most folks were
[6868.40s -> 6877.04s]  describing as the current budget offering. That again that budget was teed up to go to public
[6877.04s -> 6885.68s]  hearing on March 23rd and then coronavirus and COVID-19 change. Everything was kind of
[6887.76s -> 6894.96s]  stopped and changes began. We first had a postponement in the dates. Then we had some social distancing
[6894.96s -> 6902.40s]  requirements which made town meeting formal government unworkable. Government of a month executed
[6902.88s -> 6909.04s]  of orders seven capital I and that's the one that provides the Board of Selectman the power to
[6909.04s -> 6919.52s]  authorize the Board of Finance to determine without any annual without a referendum. On Tuesday,
[6919.52s -> 6926.72s]  April 7, pursuant to that executive order seven capital I the Board of Selectman passed the
[6926.72s -> 6935.28s]  resolution authorizing the Board of Finance to determine the fiscal year 2020 2021 budget year
[6936.00s -> 6940.96s]  consistent with another executive order that said we have to have a virtual public hearing.
[6942.16s -> 6947.68s]  Now the Board of Selectman has directed the Board of Finance to set this budget
[6948.56s -> 6956.96s]  by May 15. So that's where we are. That's what we are how we've come to this point in the process.
[6958.64s -> 6967.04s]  From from here where we go well from here the Board of Finance will again think about what
[6967.04s -> 6974.96s]  budget proposal will be sent to now a virtual public hearing. Dates are somewhat dynamic but at
[6974.96s -> 6981.04s]  this point we're thinking that a virtual public hearing will take place on Tuesday, May 12.
[6981.76s -> 6989.44s]  And then on Friday, May 15, the last day available to us we would have a Board of Finance special
[6989.44s -> 7000.40s]  meeting to determine the budget. That's where we go from here. I guess how I would start tonight's
[7000.40s -> 7008.48s]  discussion among the Board of Finance is ask the Board of Finance individually whether anybody
[7008.48s -> 7017.60s]  believes based on all the input that we got prior to tonight and whether or not that budget that
[7017.60s -> 7026.40s]  we adopted and then reflecting the 3.495 percent increase in spending the 2.39 percent increase in
[7026.40s -> 7032.96s]  the middle rate whether that budget is something we want to stay with for purposes of going through
[7032.96s -> 7042.96s]  the virtual public hearing on May 12. So I'm just going to pick people out based on where they are
[7042.96s -> 7049.92s]  looking in the squares that I have and I would ask you to answer that question with a kind of a
[7049.92s -> 7058.56s]  simple no yes. And to the extent that you feel you need to add more, I'd ask you to be brief
[7058.56s -> 7066.00s]  in the asking or in the adding of more. So on my screen Wendy you're in the number one position.
[7066.64s -> 7072.88s]  How would you answer the question you feel at that budget that we adopted March 10 seemingly
[7072.88s -> 7079.36s]  a lifetime ago. There's something that we'd want to bring to the public hearing on May 12.
[7080.40s -> 7088.72s]  In my heart I would say yes but in the reality I'm going to have to say no I don't think I think
[7088.72s -> 7096.80s]  that we need to take another look at it. I and you're in the number two position on my screen.
[7097.76s -> 7104.72s]  I'm going to say no we should not bring that budget forward. Robert Palmer.
[7104.72s -> 7114.00s]  I think that where we were when we developed that budget the thought process that we into it I
[7114.00s -> 7123.52s]  fully supported it at the time but with the economic situation as it is today and where we think
[7123.52s -> 7130.88s]  it's going to be for the next upcoming couple quarters it's not going to be a rapid recovery in
[7130.88s -> 7137.60s]  my mind. It's going to be a slow recovery and I think we'd be rather toned out to say we should go
[7137.60s -> 7143.36s]  ahead without any modifications to the current budget. I think that we have a lot of hurting
[7144.72s -> 7152.96s]  residents in Bethel and I think that they're looking to us to take a leadership stand and making
[7153.04s -> 7154.64s]  some additional cuts to where we are.
[7160.72s -> 7166.32s]  Robert said it perfectly our neighbors are struggling and I would definitely want to look at it
[7166.32s -> 7177.04s]  again. Thank you. I think that the the budget that was proposed best reflects what our town
[7177.92s -> 7183.60s]  needs and still needs. Those needs haven't changed and I'd like us to keep that in mind as we
[7183.60s -> 7189.76s]  continue to talk about the budget but I do think given the uncertainty and the anxiety that's
[7189.76s -> 7195.36s]  going on you know for our friends and neighbors and ourselves I think we owe it to ourselves to
[7195.36s -> 7201.76s]  take a look at the budget again and see if there are places that we can take some things out that
[7201.76s -> 7205.52s]  will not drastically reduce our quality of life in Bethel.
[7211.20s -> 7218.32s]  Yeah I think that just as our lives were different before COVID-19 our lives were different
[7218.32s -> 7224.96s]  when we you know cooked up that budget and I think that we it would be irresponsible not to
[7224.96s -> 7233.60s]  look at it and to to realize and I don't know how far out people are thinking but I've
[7233.60s -> 7240.00s]  the opinion that this is not going to that this is a whole cultural shift in our in our country and
[7240.00s -> 7245.92s]  our world this is not going to be like holding on to everything that we know so we have to get like
[7245.92s -> 7251.76s]  into a space where we're not you know using we have to use a different paradigm when we're doing
[7251.76s -> 7262.56s]  this I feel strongly about that so I would have to say that I agree with all that remembering that
[7262.56s -> 7270.00s]  what we're trying to wrestle with here is the year the fiscal year 21 it's the year that doesn't
[7270.00s -> 7280.88s]  begin until July 1st of 2020 and runs through June 30th of 2021 so it's even more there is even more
[7280.88s -> 7286.00s]  uncertainty to that we've got two and a half months before the year begins and then the 12
[7286.00s -> 7292.40s]  ones that follows but but that said you know based on the fact that I think all of us have heard from
[7292.40s -> 7304.24s]  folks in on the folks on the call today and then prior it does seem to me that we need to go back
[7305.04s -> 7313.92s]  and I would think that the spectrum it's my dog it's my dog so you want me to put it down
[7315.52s -> 7323.04s]  don't put the dog down okay could you translate what's the dog today he's he's saying I hear a man's voice
[7324.64s -> 7333.20s]  that's right yeah no gender um it seems like the end of the spectral of the possibilities are
[7334.64s -> 7341.68s]  something less obviously like something I wanted the spectrum something less than the 3.495
[7341.68s -> 7348.80s]  percent budget and on the other end of the spectrum it's a I think what we've heard is a budget that
[7348.80s -> 7356.80s]  has a zero dollar increase over the prior year but those those are kind of the anchors of the spectrum
[7356.80s -> 7365.68s]  deposits I would suggest I would throw out to begin the discussion that you think about a middle
[7365.68s -> 7373.04s]  ground and that middle ground being something that achieves a zero percent increase in the middle
[7373.04s -> 7381.20s]  rate or as close to that as we can then and understanding the priorities of the day and covering
[7381.20s -> 7387.20s]  the priorities of the day without I think it was me who said trying to without impacting the day
[7387.20s -> 7398.08s]  today quality of the folks and I want to thank you for the opportunity I wanted to throw out one
[7398.08s -> 7404.24s]  thing for your consideration before you carry out a discussion which your board members may or
[7404.24s -> 7410.08s]  may not know about one of the most recent governors orders and I can't remember which number it was
[7410.08s -> 7417.68s]  there now 27 of them mandated that every town and Connecticut adopt some kind of a tax relief
[7417.68s -> 7424.72s]  program the there are two options that are offered one of them is a 90 day deferral on taxes
[7424.72s -> 7432.80s]  to qualify taxpayers the qualification is that anybody who can attest without much documentation
[7432.80s -> 7438.88s]  it's not difficult who can attest that they have they either have suffered or will suffer a 20%
[7438.88s -> 7445.68s]  drop in income due to the due to the pandemic shutdown and that would affect both our April
[7445.68s -> 7452.08s]  tax billings and our June tax billings and what that would do is for those qualified individuals it
[7452.08s -> 7458.96s]  would push the April billing due date back to August one and the June billing back to October one
[7458.96s -> 7465.44s]  the second of the options is reducing the annual interest rate that's charged by state law from
[7465.44s -> 7473.68s]  18% down to 3% that would be a 0.25% per month and again under the or under the governor's orders
[7473.68s -> 7480.72s]  every town must adopt one or the other or both of those things and the deadline for us to do this
[7481.36s -> 7491.12s]  is we have to notify the office about office of policy management by April 25 so this will be on
[7491.12s -> 7496.16s]  next week's Board of Selectment agenda so I want to get to be aware of that because that may
[7496.16s -> 7502.96s]  color your discussion as you debate the definition. Hey man if you don't have to comment but if people
[7502.96s -> 7508.96s]  can't pay their taxes now they're not going to be able to pay two payments in 90 days that's the
[7508.96s -> 7513.92s]  problem we're all talking about they're struggling to pay it now when a tenant normally gets behind
[7513.92s -> 7523.36s]  an event why are they going to be able to pay their rent twice in one month. All right. This would be
[7523.36s -> 7531.92s]  this would be available to landlords as well. Look at that that is a very important decision to be made
[7535.20s -> 7539.76s]  at the April 25 is there a Board of Selectment meeting on April 25th?
[7540.56s -> 7547.52s]  April 21st Tuesday. The deadlines of 25th but they'll be the board. Correct. Yeah.
[7548.72s -> 7558.96s]  I would encourage folks who are on this call again now are all 113 participants to dial in or
[7558.96s -> 7564.64s]  zoom in to that call because I think Nicky raised some points that are valid and need to be
[7564.72s -> 7571.84s]  considered in that discussion. Again the Board of Selectment is where folks would need to discuss
[7571.84s -> 7578.08s]  further the deadline that we have if they want to talk about it. The deadline that we the Board
[7578.08s -> 7583.84s]  of Finance have as the May 15th deadline. So that sounds like an important date for folks that
[7583.84s -> 7589.28s]  again April 21st the Board of Selectment meeting to get a service. It's very tough.
[7589.28s -> 7599.28s]  Can I just say Cynthia? I don't know how you got muted so I know I did it myself for a minute.
[7599.28s -> 7606.88s]  Okay. Okay. That's fine. I just dyed it. Well she'd think I did it. No, I didn't. I am
[7606.88s -> 7613.12s]  parent. I'm not that parent. All right. So try to come me back to what are we going to try to do.
[7613.12s -> 7619.20s]  Again I would put out there as a suggestion that we at least use for a target a budget
[7619.20s -> 7627.36s]  that results in a zero percent increase in knowledge. There'll be an increase in spending
[7627.36s -> 7632.48s]  but a zero percent increase in knowledge. And so with focusing again on the things that are
[7632.48s -> 7637.44s]  important, the agencies of the day, right? We want to make sure that we focus on health so the
[7637.44s -> 7644.16s]  health department gets fully funded. We want to make sure we focus issues from safety but not
[7644.88s -> 7652.24s]  anything so that would be the meeting and the fire department. And what obviously would have to also
[7652.24s -> 7659.76s]  take care of all of our contractual obligations for compensation and debt service. So choose that
[7659.76s -> 7666.16s]  it. I would suggest again just to get things up on the board to start talking about. We look at
[7666.16s -> 7673.36s]  that budget that we adopted back on March 10th and think about the following changes. And we'll go
[7673.36s -> 7682.48s]  around the board again, making a list of these possibilities. My, the first suggestion would be to
[7682.48s -> 7692.96s]  reduce debt service. And that's the department of 440 account 548. That's the general obligation
[7692.96s -> 7701.12s]  ban principle. We would reduce that by $250,000. Let's be clear. The reason why we have that
[7701.12s -> 7708.24s]  capability is that this board, being somewhat thoughtful three years ago, put a plan in place to
[7708.24s -> 7714.40s]  get rid of our short-term debt. So that's gone. And now we have very little of ban
[7716.64s -> 7723.20s]  without saying that we're not related to current construction. So we've opened ourselves up with some
[7723.20s -> 7730.88s]  flexibility to reduce the ban debt service and take advantage of what likely are going to be
[7730.88s -> 7738.72s]  very low long-term rates when we refinance in the July time thing. So the first item of possible
[7738.72s -> 7747.20s]  cut would be that 250,000 from debt service. Second suggestion perhaps would be to reduce
[7747.20s -> 7753.68s]  road construction. That's that's near and dear to all of us. We've had a plan in place for a long
[7753.68s -> 7759.92s]  time to try to get a regular rhythm to make sure that the town was never falling behind on road
[7759.92s -> 7767.36s]  repair. You know, I think as a lot of people have said, these are important times, difficult times.
[7768.24s -> 7774.40s]  And while the first item of the debt service might not have any real implications to the quality
[7774.48s -> 7782.00s]  of what the construction does, but it would be, again, an item that we would consider to kind of get
[7782.00s -> 7790.64s]  everybody on board with some further reductions. Are you making a motion? What's that?
[7790.64s -> 7794.88s]  I just want to know if there's going to be a motion or what are we're going to...
[7796.24s -> 7798.96s]  Are you making a motion to make that cut? That's all we know.
[7799.36s -> 7808.56s]  Just putting a look like we've got potential. Can I ask one question?
[7809.76s -> 7816.64s]  You said get to a 0% mill rate increase. Do we know what dollar amount decreased that is?
[7818.24s -> 7824.80s]  Yeah, I think what we've talked about before and Bob K, correct me if I'm wrong, we need to reduce
[7824.80s -> 7832.16s]  the current level of spending by $1,600,000. Yeah, that's what I figured out.
[7832.88s -> 7835.04s]  Can you say that number again, Bob? I couldn't hear you.
[7835.60s -> 7844.80s]  $1,605,000 was the spending cut we had talked about before to get us to this 0,
[7844.80s -> 7847.20s]  mill rate increase.
[7847.20s -> 7852.88s]  And then that's assuming the growth and the grand list was 973,000?
[7853.84s -> 7855.04s]  Yes, correct.
[7856.72s -> 7857.20s]  You got it.
[7860.08s -> 7867.20s]  Next item, the benefits line, and here are two, $200,000.
[7868.32s -> 7882.40s]  And in time, the department, 390 accounts, 5114, and 5115, those are the
[7882.40s -> 7888.08s]  pension accounts who vote the town and the police department. What we had done in the initial
[7888.08s -> 7896.56s]  budget was why to adopt the, actually early adopt, the revised standards for funding the pensions.
[7897.60s -> 7902.48s]  We through our pension advisor apparently have been told that nobody has early adopted
[7902.48s -> 7911.60s]  those new standards, and it seems like now we would continue to fund the pensions fully
[7911.60s -> 7919.04s]  under our base fund, and come out. We want to get ahead of the funding over funded as we
[7919.04s -> 7920.64s]  were hoping to do initially.
[7922.80s -> 7928.80s]  Hey, Bob, you didn't put a number on the roads. Did you just make sure you didn't have an idea
[7928.80s -> 7932.48s]  if you wanted to cut? I had a grain cramp, $200,000.
[7932.48s -> 7947.04s]  So 250 undead service, 200 on road construction, 200 on benefits, utilities. We would take that
[7947.04s -> 7954.96s]  down by 40,000. And again, that's by the benefit of realizing the solar farm output.
[7956.00s -> 7961.92s]  We had a study done from the person who kind of specializes in the area of that
[7962.56s -> 7969.04s]  solar farm, and the thinking there is we would be able to realize $40,000 of utility
[7971.04s -> 7972.56s]  and we're kind of all encompassing.
[7975.76s -> 7986.80s]  The next area is going to be probably the most controversial. We have spoken to a number of
[7986.80s -> 7998.96s]  folks out there. I'm not suggesting them, but it would be to cut to put them in operating budget
[7998.96s -> 8003.52s]  by $300,000. I'm sorry, Bob, how much?
[8004.24s -> 8006.40s]  $300,000.
[8006.56s -> 8020.16s]  And then the final item on this suggested list is to take $10,000 out of the contracted services,
[8020.16s -> 8025.44s]  building maintenance account, and that's the Department of 180 account 510.
[8025.92s -> 8036.16s]  If I do the math right on that list, that would be $1 million of cost takeouts.
[8038.56s -> 8043.92s]  Again, the Board of Ed one is the most controversial. We think the other ones are not
[8044.88s -> 8045.68s]  quality of life.
[8050.88s -> 8057.84s]  That's kind of my initial list. We can go around the horn again as to whether or not people.
[8057.84s -> 8060.32s]  That's a very good move at the Act of the In-House.
[8064.24s -> 8069.84s]  Go around the horn to see what folks think about that, and maybe what other additional
[8069.84s -> 8074.24s]  suggestions we have to consider in adjusting the budget.
[8075.52s -> 8079.68s]  This time, I'll go around an opposite direction. When do you earn a number one position last time?
[8079.68s -> 8081.68s]  Now I'll put you last.
[8081.68s -> 8082.72s]  It'll be last.
[8084.08s -> 8085.28s]  Never last in our hearts.
[8086.88s -> 8088.32s]  If you're starting with you.
[8089.36s -> 8090.24s]  Yeah, oh, okay.
[8090.32s -> 8099.60s]  All these things, I mean, look, I love the highway.
[8099.60s -> 8104.88s]  Funding the highway with cash, that's my thing. That's the only thing that I'm wavering on,
[8104.88s -> 8107.36s]  but we have to do it.
[8110.32s -> 8118.96s]  Frankly, I think that we have to go to a different level of thinking and not just say we are
[8118.96s -> 8126.32s]  cutting the dollar amount, because we have to re, I think we have to shift our thinking.
[8126.32s -> 8135.84s]  I honestly, I talked to someone at the Labor Department yesterday and was told that the numbers
[8135.84s -> 8143.12s]  that we have that go up to March 15th are going to look pretty good, but the person in the research
[8143.12s -> 8153.76s]  department said that, I'm sorry, I'm trying to find a piece of paper, said that it was taken
[8153.76s -> 8160.00s]  in a survey, March 15th, that going forward, those statistics are going to be very grim.
[8160.00s -> 8165.04s]  I mean, the guy said it, just said it, and his name was Pat Flaherty, by the way,
[8165.04s -> 8166.24s]  is in the research department.
[8167.68s -> 8170.40s]  I don't think we know what we're in for.
[8170.40s -> 8172.80s]  I don't think this is going to be an overnight thing.
[8172.80s -> 8176.96s]  I think when people talk about the new normal, I don't think the new normal exists.
[8176.96s -> 8184.16s]  This is so different from every single thing that we can talk about trying to keep everything
[8184.16s -> 8189.52s]  intact, but I think we have to get a little more organic, each department, and that includes
[8189.52s -> 8196.96s]  the board of ed, because I understand that they have services in place that they extend to
[8197.04s -> 8203.52s]  students, but that is shifting, and it's not about getting back on a horse that's already
[8203.52s -> 8204.48s]  run out of the barn.
[8204.48s -> 8207.44s]  You know, there's a lot of stuff that has to be shifted.
[8207.44s -> 8217.44s]  I also don't believe that it's fair to even put into play the fact that the tax relief
[8217.44s -> 8223.04s]  has to be decided April 25th, or that we won't get reimbursed for a year.
[8223.20s -> 8230.16s]  It's not fair to put that burden of poning up money upfront on the taxpayer who may have
[8230.16s -> 8231.76s]  their house foreclosed on.
[8231.76s -> 8237.60s]  This isn't, you know, and with all due respect to everybody that spoke, and I love public input.
[8238.56s -> 8244.48s]  Every person, except maybe three or four, were either teachers on the board of ed, or
[8246.32s -> 8250.00s]  had some stakeholder, or it was his first selection.
[8250.00s -> 8252.64s]  So I appreciate everyone's opinion.
[8252.64s -> 8254.32s]  I don't think that represents the public.
[8254.32s -> 8258.56s]  I think that the public hearing will represent more of the public, and I hope that will be very
[8258.56s -> 8259.76s]  well attended.
[8259.76s -> 8263.76s]  So that said, I think we've got to get a little more organic about this.
[8263.76s -> 8268.48s]  I don't have any specific things to cut, but I would have to say that the board of ed needs to
[8268.48s -> 8275.28s]  really take a look at something other than the maintenance account, and one more thing,
[8275.28s -> 8281.36s]  and I don't want to go on, I really don't, but, you know, they're 1% that they can keep from
[8281.36s -> 8288.40s]  their surplus at the end of the year in Dr. Carver's memo, so that we can't count on that.
[8288.40s -> 8294.40s]  Well, they shouldn't count on that because it's an overage, it's a surplus.
[8294.40s -> 8295.76s]  It's like counting on a bonus.
[8296.48s -> 8303.28s]  Maybe you won't get enough to keep 1% that'll be even, you know, significant, but that's
[8303.28s -> 8304.88s]  the kind of thing we're looking at.
[8311.68s -> 8314.00s]  You ended abruptly, was that intentionally?
[8314.00s -> 8314.80s]  Oh, me?
[8314.80s -> 8315.76s]  Yeah.
[8315.76s -> 8316.64s]  Oh, I know.
[8316.64s -> 8321.60s]  I just sort of put the break down because I didn't want to talk at talk, so I said thank you.
[8322.16s -> 8324.48s]  So nothing to add to the list?
[8325.20s -> 8326.32s]  No, I don't right now.
[8327.28s -> 8332.64s]  All right, well, I said the board of ed needs to, it would be helpful if I will say this.
[8332.64s -> 8337.92s]  It would be so helpful if there were departments who would come forward and say,
[8337.92s -> 8339.84s]  we can save money here.
[8340.88s -> 8342.24s]  I've not heard that.
[8342.24s -> 8347.36s]  I really only heard asking for more with the exception of a few departments.
[8347.36s -> 8352.24s]  I mean, it's easy to make a case for maybe no extra dog park for small dogs or something.
[8352.24s -> 8353.28s]  That's easy.
[8353.28s -> 8354.80s]  It's going to be really hard.
[8355.68s -> 8358.00s]  And you know, who never, never feels this?
[8358.08s -> 8360.48s]  The unions, the unions.
[8360.48s -> 8361.20s]  I'm sorry.
[8362.00s -> 8363.52s]  No wiggle room there.
[8363.52s -> 8365.28s]  So, you know, like those on.
[8366.16s -> 8367.20s]  And I think that's a problem.
[8367.20s -> 8368.48s]  That's what I mean about organic.
[8368.48s -> 8372.32s]  Things have to change and not just sniping away money on this budget.
[8375.60s -> 8377.44s]  Do you have got you in the number two hole?
[8379.20s -> 8379.84s]  Thanks, Bob.
[8381.20s -> 8383.36s]  So here's my thoughts.
[8383.36s -> 8387.36s]  And when I started, I said, I think we need to look at cuts that don't dramatically
[8387.36s -> 8390.32s]  decrease our quality of life here in Bethel.
[8391.52s -> 8396.00s]  I think most of the things that you talked about are probably in that bucket.
[8396.64s -> 8401.68s]  I think people will see some degradation of our roads if we cut $200,000.
[8402.40s -> 8403.68s]  And we're going to have to accept that.
[8403.68s -> 8406.72s]  And we're going to have to own that if we're going to make that cut.
[8407.52s -> 8411.52s]  I think $300,000 out of the board of ed is just too much.
[8411.52s -> 8414.40s]  I think they're already struggling and I think it's too much.
[8415.36s -> 8420.64s]  Sorry, I'll be willing to vote for a decrease in the board of ed budget.
[8420.64s -> 8422.56s]  I don't know that $300 is the number for me.
[8426.32s -> 8427.44s]  Nick, I've got you up next.
[8428.48s -> 8430.48s]  All right, I made a list.
[8432.40s -> 8439.60s]  There was new hires in the board of ed and it was total of $378,000.
[8440.16s -> 8446.56s]  If you cut the $300,000, they still had $78,000 to hire that principal.
[8446.56s -> 8449.20s]  I'm sorry, the administrator in the school.
[8449.20s -> 8450.72s]  And I know they're getting another grade.
[8450.72s -> 8452.88s]  So I think there's some wiggle room there.
[8452.88s -> 8458.00s]  So I would support the $300,000 because $378 was all new hires.
[8458.56s -> 8465.68s]  I think the majority of this town would be happy if they got the same services as last year.
[8465.68s -> 8468.56s]  I understand debt services we have to pay for.
[8468.56s -> 8471.60s]  We have to pay for contractual obligations.
[8471.60s -> 8476.88s]  But in this world that we're living in, if I told my family we can go on the same
[8476.88s -> 8482.00s]  vacation as we went on last year, I think that's a big win for what everybody's living to right now.
[8482.64s -> 8488.24s]  But the 460 account I think has to take a hit for $50,000.
[8489.84s -> 8492.16s]  We may have to put off a gym.
[8492.88s -> 8496.56s]  We may have to put off something in that maintenance account.
[8497.20s -> 8502.32s]  In this times we live in, so I would support a $50,000 cut at a 460.
[8503.20s -> 8505.52s]  And 12 months goes by quick.
[8505.52s -> 8509.44s]  If everything is fine, I'd be willing to spend the money next year.
[8509.44s -> 8512.64s]  But right now, I would support a $50,000 cut there.
[8514.56s -> 8520.16s]  Again, hiring anybody new in this environment I think is wrong.
[8520.16s -> 8525.20s]  When there's people that are unemployed, there's people that are
[8525.28s -> 8526.96s]  got a reduction in their pay.
[8528.48s -> 8531.44s]  I have a hard time really supporting new hires.
[8532.08s -> 8534.64s]  I would not hire another new officer.
[8534.64s -> 8537.20s]  I would stay status quo.
[8537.20s -> 8541.04s]  I'd be happy that we kept everybody employed in this town.
[8541.04s -> 8544.48s]  And I would cut $54,000 out of a new officer.
[8544.48s -> 8546.16s]  I know that's not a big win.
[8547.36s -> 8553.68s]  A lot of people with, again, emergency services, I would let that one go.
[8553.68s -> 8558.80s]  But I definitely would say, hey, we need to do maybe cut another car
[8559.52s -> 8561.12s]  and do with what we have.
[8562.96s -> 8566.96s]  We've got plenty of money in the highway department to repair these cars.
[8566.96s -> 8569.52s]  But that's, I know that's not going to fly.
[8570.16s -> 8575.28s]  Road construction, I thought 100,000, but again, 200.
[8575.28s -> 8582.00s]  You guys have done a good job with that and for those repairs, replacement of roads, but I would
[8582.00s -> 8587.20s]  support the bigger number because, again, we're trying to go with a lower mill increase.
[8588.72s -> 8595.52s]  Building department, 180, 51,01, there's part time money in there, there's 35,000.
[8596.16s -> 8600.40s]  If we come out of this thing, I don't think there's going to be building.
[8600.40s -> 8601.52s]  I think that's going to lag.
[8602.24s -> 8606.08s]  We can always add that later on if things really pick up.
[8606.08s -> 8608.80s]  I'd be in favor of cutting the part time out of that.
[8609.44s -> 8616.48s]  I know, I've said it to Matt before, we do more with less and I get it.
[8616.48s -> 8619.68s]  The government doesn't work that way like private industry,
[8619.68s -> 8622.64s]  but I don't think the building permits are going to be there,
[8622.64s -> 8624.64s]  or they're not going to be there right away.
[8624.64s -> 8627.44s]  I'm in construction, everybody's pulling back.
[8627.44s -> 8630.32s]  You're going to get the roof repairs, you're going to get the windows,
[8630.32s -> 8633.36s]  but you're not going to get big, big projects.
[8633.36s -> 8636.64s]  So I would support cutting that 35,000.
[8637.28s -> 8640.40s]  And then I don't know much about this, but the capital not recurring.
[8641.04s -> 8642.48s]  I know there's a bunch of money in there.
[8643.04s -> 8646.32s]  Can we trim that 100 or 200,000?
[8646.32s -> 8649.52s]  Since everybody's taking a hit, maybe we don't buy a truck,
[8649.52s -> 8651.52s]  or maybe we don't buy computers.
[8651.52s -> 8655.28s]  You know, I know the first selectman comes to us and says what's needed,
[8655.28s -> 8660.40s]  but I think there should be a cut if the board of ed is going to take a hit.
[8660.40s -> 8665.52s]  I think buying new things, I would support a $200,000 cut there.
[8666.88s -> 8668.08s]  That's all the notes I have.
[8671.76s -> 8672.32s]  Robert.
[8674.96s -> 8675.60s]  Thanks, Bob.
[8677.92s -> 8683.36s]  This is very painful, and I think as evident to the people listening on this call,
[8684.80s -> 8688.48s]  there was a lot of discussion going on about these items.
[8689.12s -> 8697.52s]  The most painful, of course, I think is the schools,
[8698.16s -> 8701.04s]  second painful would be, of course, the roads.
[8701.04s -> 8706.00s]  The roads are something that will all feel as we keep repairing our
[8707.20s -> 8708.08s]  vehicle tires.
[8708.72s -> 8714.32s]  The schools, that hits very hard because I think our community work that we're
[8714.32s -> 8721.28s]  proud of is proud because what our school board has built up and made as an institution
[8721.28s -> 8723.60s]  that we all respected like.
[8724.16s -> 8731.84s]  But I don't see a clear path to getting down to a zero budget,
[8731.84s -> 8737.60s]  and I stand by my earlier statement that there's a lot of pain out there in terms of
[8738.40s -> 8745.04s]  not only people being laid off, we can see an unemployment in this area of the country
[8746.00s -> 8754.32s]  increasing from what it was, you know, three, four percent up to probably 15 percent easily.
[8754.80s -> 8760.16s]  And the real sort of, you know, that mark that into the marketplace is not going to be
[8760.80s -> 8768.56s]  particularly rapid. And even if it is, it's not going to necessarily be back at the same
[8768.56s -> 8778.00s]  salary levels as they once were. We've seen that before in terms of people being re-employed at
[8778.00s -> 8789.20s]  different jobs at perhaps a lower level. So I'm not looking for the zero rate. I'm looking for
[8789.92s -> 8798.00s]  this is a compromise, I feel, and it takes us down to a, I don't know, where their bob or
[8798.00s -> 8805.60s]  Brad is on the call to calculate where we would be with a cut of this nature in terms of what
[8805.60s -> 8810.48s]  that would mean at a mill rate. Brad's on the call, I don't believe.
[8810.48s -> 8812.32s]  I think he is. I think he's on.
[8813.52s -> 8818.16s]  Brad, can you give us an estimate based on the rates?
[8820.16s -> 8824.64s]  But Robert, just to make sure I'm probably being slow here, when you say
[8826.40s -> 8828.80s]  what the cuts, the cuts that you described?
[8828.80s -> 8830.40s]  One million dollars.
[8830.40s -> 8830.80s]  Correct.
[8832.40s -> 8838.56s]  So that's taking us down to, well, I can tell you the other day, I ran 9.50.
[8838.56s -> 8843.84s]  I didn't go to a man. I went 9.50 and it brings no rate down to 33.74.
[8843.84s -> 8854.24s]  0.33, that's under 1%, 0.98, and it equates to $71.16.
[8854.24s -> 8859.12s]  So another, you know, $50,000 is going to bring it down a little bit more.
[8860.80s -> 8861.12s]  Okay.
[8862.00s -> 8866.00s]  So Bob, again, I'm probably just being the slowest here,
[8866.72s -> 8871.92s]  making out a million dollars, brings the no rate down to 0.33.
[8871.92s -> 8873.36s]  No, that's 9.50, Bob.
[8874.08s -> 8879.28s]  I ran that the other day. I'm going to check to see if Brad is as much you don't have.
[8879.28s -> 8883.60s]  Yeah, give me just, I'm trying to, I'm trying to unmute Brad, give me just a second.
[8883.60s -> 8884.40s]  I got a finding.
[8885.76s -> 8893.12s]  The 9.50 gets a 0.33, a 0.98 percentage, and the $71.
[8896.64s -> 8905.60s]  And that is less than a 1% increase in the millery.
[8905.60s -> 8906.48s]  Is that correct, Bob?
[8907.44s -> 8909.36s]  The point 9.50.
[8909.36s -> 8910.56s]  Yes, 9.8.
[8911.76s -> 8912.88s]  Can you hear me now?
[8912.88s -> 8914.08s]  Yes.
[8914.08s -> 8919.36s]  All right. So were you looking at, there was a lot of numbers to run around when I was trying to unmute myself.
[8919.36s -> 8921.04s]  Are you looking at a million dollar cut?
[8921.76s -> 8923.44s]  Yeah, that would do to the miller.
[8923.44s -> 8929.44s]  So the million dollar cut would reduce the mill rate increase from 0.8 to 0.3.
[8933.04s -> 8936.72s]  And would make the mill rate increase percentage 0.91.
[8941.44s -> 8945.04s]  Brad, you have that third number, the average home cost?
[8946.00s -> 8951.76s]  The average home, the increase your over year would be $65.79.
[8956.32s -> 8958.56s]  I've heard any more questions for Brad.
[8958.56s -> 8960.40s]  What's the, what's the average cost?
[8960.40s -> 8961.28s]  What's the base?
[8962.56s -> 8968.56s]  The base is based on an estimated tax of a $217,000 assessed home.
[8969.12s -> 8973.20s]  That's been the same for a milling, I mean, come on.
[8973.20s -> 8974.72s]  It's got to be different.
[8974.72s -> 8975.92s]  I mean, how much is that?
[8977.84s -> 8979.36s]  Is that the median home?
[8981.44s -> 8984.64s]  It comes out to a fair market value of about $310, I think, right?
[8984.64s -> 8985.12s]  $3.50.
[8985.12s -> 8985.92s]  That area.
[8985.92s -> 8986.16s]  Yeah.
[8987.12s -> 8989.20s]  What are the taxes on that?
[8989.20s -> 8992.24s]  You're saying that $65 a year?
[8993.52s -> 8994.48s]  Is that what you're saying?
[8994.48s -> 8999.44s]  It's an increase, an increase to what?
[8999.44s -> 9002.64s]  I'm sorry to sound fit, but it's an increase to what?
[9004.16s -> 9008.32s]  $7249, $7250.
[9010.08s -> 9010.64s]  Yeah.
[9010.64s -> 9011.28s]  Okay.
[9011.28s -> 9012.24s]  So that, yeah.
[9012.24s -> 9013.04s]  Okay.
[9013.04s -> 9016.48s]  So that puts it over eight.
[9017.76s -> 9018.16s]  Let me see.
[9018.16s -> 9020.40s]  That puts it up to 73,
[9022.88s -> 9023.92s]  73, then.
[9023.92s -> 9024.40s]  All right.
[9024.40s -> 9025.36s]  Well, okay.
[9027.20s -> 9027.92s]  It works for you.
[9029.12s -> 9032.72s]  Can I ask a question of Brad or Bob?
[9034.16s -> 9036.88s]  If we had an 850 decrease,
[9037.84s -> 9042.00s]  what would the increase in the mill rate be?
[9043.52s -> 9045.76s]  Brad, I'm trying to, there you go.
[9045.76s -> 9047.76s]  I'm trying to, okay.
[9047.76s -> 9048.72s]  All right.
[9048.72s -> 9051.28s]  850,000 are decreased.
[9051.28s -> 9052.80s]  Give me one second to run that.
[9052.80s -> 9058.16s]  So the mill rate increase would be 0.38 for 1.13 percent increase
[9058.16s -> 9063.12s]  and the $217,000 assessed home would be $81.99.
[9063.92s -> 9065.36s]  Increase year over year.
[9069.04s -> 9071.12s]  Well, we could potentially gain two teachers.
[9077.12s -> 9078.72s]  Any more, any more questions?
[9078.72s -> 9081.04s]  I, I, that's, that's all for me.
[9082.24s -> 9085.12s]  Brian, you're, you're next in my, my line up there.
[9085.68s -> 9086.40s]  Okay.
[9086.40s -> 9091.36s]  I, uh, I looked at the same cuts that you had to start
[9091.52s -> 9092.72s]  to get us to a million.
[9093.36s -> 9097.60s]  Then I had some other cuts and then I had something else I wanted to talk to that,
[9098.56s -> 9104.24s]  you know, may help the situation and be able to put some stuff back into less than the pain
[9105.44s -> 9107.60s]  without increasing the mill rate.
[9108.64s -> 9116.08s]  So again, you know, the 460, I had a possible cut of 50,000 assuming the board of ed,
[9116.08s -> 9121.04s]  you know, still had the $300,000 in the contingent fund,
[9121.04s -> 9124.72s]  which again, they'll still be able to transfer money into at the end of this year.
[9125.44s -> 9130.32s]  I had a $10,000 cut for the building department off of part time,
[9130.96s -> 9136.88s]  which would bring them back to basically last year's budget of part time help.
[9139.04s -> 9145.04s]  The tree warden, I cut another 10,000 out of that, which basically brought them a little over
[9145.04s -> 9149.44s]  last year's budget in terms of the amount of work they could do.
[9150.64s -> 9158.96s]  I took 5,000 out of salt, which still left a pretty healthy amount in that account from highway.
[9160.80s -> 9167.68s]  Marchion wreck, I took another 5,000 out of building supplies, you know, just supplies because,
[9167.68s -> 9172.96s]  I mean, there's not going to be, I think the amount of sports going on this summer,
[9172.96s -> 9177.44s]  unfortunately, you know, redding is already announced that they've cancelled all summer activities,
[9177.44s -> 9183.28s]  and I think a lot of towns are going to be forced to follow suit with that because we definitely
[9183.28s -> 9190.96s]  don't want to see a reoccurrence of what's going on. I also reduced their programs back to last year's
[9190.96s -> 9195.36s]  funding, and again, that's based on the fact that I think a lot of programs are going to be cancelled
[9196.00s -> 9200.32s]  over the summer. You know, I know they do a great job with that and everything they do,
[9200.96s -> 9206.48s]  you know, brings in revenue, but again, I think in honesty, in the short term, people are going to
[9206.48s -> 9214.08s]  be very cautious about sending kids and group activities based on what we've just been through.
[9215.28s -> 9220.80s]  For the library, you know, I know we put it in, but I took the 5,000 out and I figured if we took
[9220.80s -> 9225.12s]  it out, I know we don't have control over the lines, but what I was thinking is it still
[9226.00s -> 9229.92s]  gives them the same amount of money they had last year to buy books and materials.
[9229.92s -> 9237.36s]  That was one thing that I looked at. I also looked at the senior center. They had a $10,000
[9237.36s -> 9244.16s]  increase in activities. I reduced that by 5,000. Again, my thinking was, you know, a lot of these
[9244.16s -> 9249.60s]  group activities, especially for seniors, one of our most vulnerable populations, will still
[9249.68s -> 9256.16s]  probably be lagging a little bit, you know, past the summer. So that brought an additional
[9257.04s -> 9273.20s]  $105,000 in cuts, which would bring the grand total to 1.1 million 5,000. Now, one way that I
[9273.20s -> 9281.76s]  thought that some of this eventually could get put back in would be every dollar saved this budget,
[9282.88s -> 9289.12s]  right, can get us to our number next year and possibly even pass that, you know,
[9289.12s -> 9294.32s]  depending on what the savings are. You know, I know generally on an average year we transfer about
[9294.32s -> 9302.00s]  $800,000 into the general fund or 600 somewhere around there, you know, depending on what our
[9302.00s -> 9310.88s]  uses are. If we took that money and put that into basically a special account or line for next year
[9311.60s -> 9318.64s]  and identified supplies and whatnot that we could take out of the budget this year, we could
[9318.64s -> 9327.84s]  supplement it with that and make a lot of the cuts less painful. And in addition, get the mill rate
[9327.84s -> 9336.48s]  to a zero increase. You know, so I think there is a path forward where we could get to a zero increase
[9336.48s -> 9342.96s]  in the mill rate and the cuts wouldn't look as bad because some of that could be put back in based
[9342.96s -> 9348.96s]  on savings and using that money that we're going to have at the end of this budget cycle for next year.
[9348.96s -> 9351.44s]  So that's kind of what my thought process was.
[9352.16s -> 9358.32s]  And I sneak in a quick question to Bob Kassowski because it pertains or do you want me to wait?
[9358.32s -> 9359.12s]  I'll be happy to wait.
[9361.52s -> 9377.04s]  Okay, so I'm sorry, my brain just stopped. So I wrote, I apologize. All right, go on because I wrote
[9377.04s -> 9383.68s]  something down now. We can't find it. So I can ask a quick question of Brian. Yeah, fine. So you
[9383.68s -> 9390.08s]  had 1.1 million of cuts by adding the additional things you just talked about to the existing proposal
[9390.08s -> 9397.44s]  that Bob talked about, right? Yeah, it was 1.105. But 1.6 is where we would get to a zero percent
[9397.44s -> 9403.60s]  mill rate increased. Right. And that's why I told you we could use the money that's left over from this
[9403.60s -> 9412.64s]  year to create a special fund for next year where we could take some budget items out and these
[9412.64s -> 9417.92s]  savings can be used to pay for those items. The items would still be paid for and they would still
[9417.92s -> 9424.24s]  have them. It would just come from the money that we have left over this year. We transfer into an
[9424.24s -> 9429.44s]  account, almost like we had talked about sinking funds and stuff like that in the past. And we could
[9429.44s -> 9436.48s]  use it to fund some of the items in next year's budget, thus keeping a zero percent mill increase
[9436.48s -> 9442.24s]  but still providing the supplies and the items that they've requested. So maybe I just don't
[9442.24s -> 9448.64s]  understand because there would be $500,000 additional that we would have to earmark to be handled
[9448.64s -> 9454.56s]  by that special fund. Right. So what would be your leverage? On an average year, we carry over
[9454.56s -> 9460.96s]  seven to 800,000 that we put into the general fund or use to pay off more short-term debt.
[9460.96s -> 9465.84s]  So it's not a stretch of the imagination that we can get there by any means. We're there almost
[9465.84s -> 9473.52s]  every single year. And so there's even more than 7 to 800,000. Brian, the problem is going into
[9473.52s -> 9481.12s]  next year's budget, the 22 budget, you're going to be behind $500,000. I get it. I understand.
[9481.12s -> 9487.28s]  I mean, we've done something similar to that with capital programs and the rating agencies don't
[9487.28s -> 9492.48s]  mind that but when you're doing it to balance your budget or use it to mitigate the mill rate,
[9493.28s -> 9497.76s]  they're not crazy about that. Mr. Chairman, I remember my question.
[9499.36s -> 9502.96s]  I would like to ask Mr. Kuzlowski a question to Brian's point,
[9503.68s -> 9508.88s]  that sounds like a fancy way of buying down the mill rate with non-lapsing funds. And I don't
[9508.88s -> 9514.64s]  think you can do that. I mean, I would like to have the chair and Mr. Kuzlowski research that,
[9514.64s -> 9519.28s]  because that sounds like a dangerous thing to do. I have a way.
[9519.28s -> 9524.96s]  Can I speak for that one second to Matt's comment. Other towns use the general fund balance to pay
[9524.96s -> 9532.00s]  down their mill rate. It's something that happens in numerous towns, rich fields on it,
[9532.00s -> 9538.00s]  other towns have done it. So it's not some new idea that they use money to buy down the mill rate
[9538.00s -> 9543.76s]  for next year. You're correct. It's like a grant. It could put us in the rears for the next year's
[9543.76s -> 9549.68s]  budget. But again, it gets us through this year. Hopefully, we see the return in the third quarter
[9549.68s -> 9555.76s]  or fourth quarter where some of the leading economists in the world think that the economy
[9555.76s -> 9562.96s]  will take off in the third or fourth quarter and it just gives us time to accomplish what we want
[9562.96s -> 9571.76s]  to accomplish without, you know, overly stopping these departments from, you know,
[9572.48s -> 9578.24s]  obtaining and completing their mission. You know, my reluctance to raise the mill rate is because
[9578.24s -> 9583.60s]  there's not a democratic process here. I understand what the governor did. I understand this is the
[9583.60s -> 9589.68s]  cards that I've been dealt, but I can only go by last year's data. And last year's data,
[9589.68s -> 9595.60s]  the budget, the budget was approved at a certain point. For me to raise taxes, and I'm already
[9595.60s -> 9601.36s]  agreeing to raise spending, right? In principle, I'm just against it because of that, that there's
[9601.36s -> 9609.52s]  no democratic process here. It's basically, you know, circumventing that process. I prefer that
[9609.52s -> 9614.00s]  we wait until June and see if these restrictions are over. Then it's much easier to present a budget
[9614.00s -> 9619.28s]  that everyone could vote on. So that's just why I'm where I'm at. Okay, just for the record,
[9619.28s -> 9625.52s]  I don't dislike your idea. And I have had conversations with Bob Kuzlowski and Bob Manpreet over
[9625.52s -> 9631.68s]  the past couple of weeks. So I will leave the answer to them. Whether that's a good idea with
[9631.68s -> 9639.52s]  our bond rating is not my concern. It's really, it's your boards. So, Brian, just to follow up on that,
[9639.52s -> 9645.12s]  I mean, I know Richfield does that a lot. They've been a AAA town for years and years and years,
[9645.12s -> 9650.40s]  how long we've been AAA. And the rating agencies view us differently than they do Richfield.
[9652.00s -> 9661.52s]  Little Bethel, who just became a AAA 5, 10, 7 years ago, starts to do this in an economy where maybe
[9662.48s -> 9667.52s]  we're on distress and we're not. The sound of Bethel has a nice fund balance right now. And we can
[9667.52s -> 9672.88s]  accommodate the capital programs, but they don't like to see something like that happening all of a
[9672.88s -> 9679.36s]  sudden. But Bob, let's say, let's say we took a short-term band out. And I know we're not,
[9681.68s -> 9687.60s]  you know, we're not, we've done a good job paying down the short-term debt. I said that at the last
[9687.60s -> 9692.88s]  budget, you know, deliberations, but bands are going to be at an all-time low right now. So,
[9693.44s -> 9701.36s]  I mean, if we borrowed just short and with the understanding that we're going to pay it off when
[9701.36s -> 9706.80s]  that money comes in in the end of nine months, would that really hurt our bond rating?
[9707.60s -> 9711.68s]  That's, that's, and again, you know, you're much more versed on this than I'm going to defer to your,
[9712.96s -> 9718.24s]  you know, expertise. But I mean, it seems like it's almost free money. And if we set the, even if we
[9718.24s -> 9722.24s]  put the money in the general fund and then pay it off, are they really going to be upset that we
[9722.24s -> 9728.40s]  paid that small amount off on short-term debt? I don't think they would. But the other part of it is,
[9728.40s -> 9734.16s]  in a year or less than a year, we're going to be bonding from $40 million for the two schools.
[9734.16s -> 9738.00s]  I don't want to do anything that's going to jeopardize that. I don't want to drop from a
[9738.00s -> 9741.92s]  triple A to a double A and all of a sudden, the increased course is going to be tremendous.
[9742.56s -> 9747.36s]  All right. I get it. And just to, just to put this in context for folks,
[9747.36s -> 9752.00s]  like this is great. We still got a hundred, over a hundred people on this call. God,
[9752.00s -> 9757.04s]  God bless you. You all on the board of finance, you have at least as much stamina as we do.
[9758.64s -> 9767.60s]  But what, why this is important is that the Bob Kuzlowski's point in July, we, or they're about,
[9767.60s -> 9774.56s]  we're going to be going out to the public to raise $40 million of bonds. And that's to
[9774.56s -> 9781.28s]  permanently refinance out the temporary financing we put in place for the school renovations.
[9782.40s -> 9788.16s]  At that time, the rating agencies will be asked to look at our creditworthiness.
[9789.44s -> 9794.48s]  Bob Kuzlowski's point, we're currently a triple A, the highest possible rating.
[9795.36s -> 9803.28s]  The rating agencies represent the bondholders, not the town of Bethel, right? So they will look at
[9803.28s -> 9810.88s]  our debt from the perspective of that safe debt as an investment. In making that assessment,
[9810.88s -> 9816.48s]  the rating agencies look to the practices of the municipality. And to the extent that the
[9816.48s -> 9824.64s]  rating agencies see municipalities kind of using fund balance, operating costs, they can
[9824.64s -> 9834.32s]  see that in negative. And they'll ding the town in its rating. We asked our bond council advisor,
[9834.32s -> 9841.28s]  excuse me, we asked our bond advisor to price out what the difference would be in a million
[9841.28s -> 9848.24s]  dollar bond issuance if we were downgrade from triple A to single A. Now granted, it's many,
[9848.24s -> 9855.04s]  many notches down, but the rating agencies tend to be quick on the way down, much quicker so than
[9855.04s -> 9860.88s]  they are on the way up. The difference in pricing on that $40 million bond issuance was estimated
[9860.88s -> 9868.88s]  to be $4 million. So we're trying to maintain our triple A to avoid additional interest expenses.
[9868.88s -> 9873.52s]  So by way of background, that's why this discussion is so important. Well, Bob, can I ask you a
[9873.52s -> 9884.40s]  question? Okay, could I have a question, Bob? Which one? You, Bob, Manfredo. So you were very
[9884.40s -> 9891.84s]  interested, you were very interested in knowing the savings this year too. You know, what was your plan
[9892.48s -> 9899.36s]  to use that towards next year's budget? Was there a plan that you had that wouldn't hurt our
[9900.88s -> 9906.00s]  bond rating kind of to what I'm saying right now? No, great question. And I kind of thought this
[9906.00s -> 9915.28s]  is where you were going actually, Brian, is the end of the year to what we have. And at least to my
[9915.28s -> 9920.32s]  notes, and maybe my notes are incomplete, but the savings weren't that much, but we would have
[9920.32s -> 9925.36s]  some savings at the end of the year. We would know what those numbers are because the books would
[9925.36s -> 9932.00s]  be closed. And we would then rather than putting that amount into our general fund, we would put it
[9932.00s -> 9938.16s]  in a special account to be used in the following year. That is something the rating agencies,
[9938.16s -> 9945.20s]  I believe, will accept because again, to Bob K's point, the money is in the coffer and now we
[9945.20s -> 9951.28s]  allocate it. So if we were to have savings, for example, at the end of the year, above and beyond
[9951.28s -> 9958.64s]  the additional proceeds, we typically get from the access of the actual collection rate over our
[9958.64s -> 9964.64s]  budgeted collection rate. And right, so true savings. And we were to capture those true savings and
[9964.64s -> 9974.00s]  put them into reserve account. That would be the favorite. So Bob, maybe what we do is just ask
[9974.56s -> 9982.88s]  you know, at some point, you know, to recess this meeting and ask that, you know, we get some
[9982.88s -> 9988.16s]  better numbers if we decide to have a special meeting next week or whatever we want to do that. So
[9988.16s -> 9994.88s]  we have an idea on, hey, what are the real savings that we can, you know, expect to have, you know,
[9994.88s -> 9999.92s]  talk to some department head see if there's anything they could do now to really help us with next
[9999.92s -> 10008.40s]  year's budget and not, you know, impact their ability to provide the services by, you know, like I
[10008.40s -> 10013.28s]  said, because let's face it, a lot of things are down right now, you know, we're not, you know,
[10013.28s -> 10017.68s]  doing a lot of the same things we were. So if we could capture those savings now, it'll help us,
[10018.72s -> 10024.24s]  you know, so much into next year's budget. So that would be my suggestion just to kind of,
[10025.04s -> 10028.88s]  you know, I think we let everyone speak about some, unless I'm missing some.
[10028.88s -> 10033.84s]  Except me. No, I'm sorry Wendy, I forgot you went first. I would never cut you out, but after
[10033.84s -> 10038.88s]  Wendy speaks, I mean, we'll have a really good idea of where everyone's heads are in thoughts and
[10038.88s -> 10045.36s]  maybe just take a recess and let's ask our department heads or the first selectman and the schools
[10045.36s -> 10048.88s]  to tell us, you know, what type of savings do you think we could have at the end of the year?
[10048.88s -> 10053.68s]  I did want to ask Bob my question that I've been trying to ask and I did remember if you don't
[10053.68s -> 10058.24s]  mind, it has to do with the bond rating and what exactly what Brian was talking about.
[10058.96s -> 10063.68s]  May I please? And then Wendy, I want you to talk the rest of it. Can I just ask Bob what he
[10063.68s -> 10069.52s]  thinks about that? Whether that would be a good way to proceed after Wendy and Cynthia asked her question.
[10070.48s -> 10074.24s]  And again, to this Bob, you Bob, Bob Manfreda.
[10077.28s -> 10082.48s]  We'll come back to that, but yes, so Brian and you and anything else.
[10084.00s -> 10091.84s]  Well, yeah, it was about the fun balance. And you know, this has been a bone of
[10091.84s -> 10097.04s]  contention over the years and it's been suggested before. And I understand that the rating agencies
[10097.04s -> 10102.24s]  don't want to see you, you know, the town plug it up a sinking ship. But to Brian's point,
[10103.92s -> 10108.00s]  there's got to be a way to structure it. I know that the first year I was on the board of
[10108.00s -> 10115.12s]  finance, Matt Nickerbacher was proposing pretty much what Brian was suggesting and trying to find
[10115.12s -> 10123.20s]  a mechanism that we could somehow configure the part of the fun balance to I don't even want to
[10123.20s -> 10129.60s]  use the word offset because I know how the rating agencies are. But I can't imagine that in a pandemic
[10129.60s -> 10136.48s]  that rating agencies aren't going to have to, you know, be a little bit flexible. I mean, you know,
[10136.48s -> 10142.56s]  not to the point where I just can't see the rating agencies slapping some of the town down two
[10142.56s -> 10149.84s]  points. And my old question to Bob K is, do you know how long Richfield's been a triple A town?
[10149.84s -> 10155.68s]  Just curious. As you said, they've been really long time. I know it's all longer than us.
[10155.68s -> 10159.28s]  We've been five to seven years. We originally got it with the standard of course.
[10159.84s -> 10166.32s]  But we pay good. We pay. We've got a good record, you know, we pay. And so, you know,
[10166.32s -> 10171.68s]  that's just every something interesting though. They unprecedented. It came in a year later.
[10172.56s -> 10176.56s]  And I mentioned to me because they wanted to do the analysis. And I said, hey, we were just
[10176.56s -> 10181.68s]  rated triple A by a standard and pause. They said, well, that's nice. But we want to see
[10181.68s -> 10186.00s]  how a fun balance is going to go over the next couple of years. We want to see growth in that.
[10186.00s -> 10191.28s]  And we want to see payments to the pension plan. And it was for another year after that that
[10191.28s -> 10197.68s]  they actually gave us their triple A. And just to the point now, I want to see in two or three years,
[10197.68s -> 10202.08s]  everybody have a job. But I think things are going to change very dramatically. And that's why I'm
[10202.08s -> 10207.44s]  thinking, you know, to Brian's point to, you know, if we can find a way forward, that would be awesome
[10207.44s -> 10212.56s]  to have a zero percent increase to the mill rate. Thank you. Wendy, take it away.
[10213.12s -> 10221.20s]  Hey, get away, Wendy. I cannot support a $300,000 cut to the board event. That is just to me
[10221.84s -> 10230.80s]  too severe. A lesser amount. I'm not happy with, but I think we can do.
[10232.08s -> 10240.00s]  I would also like to see if there is any money left in this current fiscal year, any savings
[10240.00s -> 10247.36s]  that we can come up with that that money can be like Bob Manfreda said, you know, earmarked
[10247.36s -> 10255.44s]  or put in a special account that we could use to offset some of the cuts that we may have to make.
[10257.68s -> 10265.76s]  And, you know, I mean, it's the real world. Yes, we're going to have a new norm, a no norm,
[10266.32s -> 10274.48s]  back to normal. We don't know. I wish we had some more time on this. I would like if we could
[10274.48s -> 10281.44s]  to recess this meeting to a different time. I don't think that we're at that point that we can
[10282.00s -> 10294.48s]  really come up with a solid number. I don't know. I just don't know.
[10295.44s -> 10303.12s]  Go ahead now. To the question about department heads, I just want the board to know that
[10304.72s -> 10310.96s]  this has started five, six weeks ago. We are conducting two staff meetings a week, one for
[10310.96s -> 10317.28s]  emergency operations and one for general operations. We go over the budget and where we stand today
[10318.00s -> 10323.36s]  every week. And I want to assure this board that we're not going to know
[10324.16s -> 10329.76s]  what anything other than what Bob Kuzlowski has told you until we get to the very end of the year
[10329.76s -> 10335.52s]  and it's July. And we can't wait that long to have a budget. There are no major savings on
[10335.52s -> 10341.76s]  the horizon. Bob has already given you every penny of what we can find so far. Just to let you know
[10342.48s -> 10350.40s]  to Nick's point, right now, building permit applications are not falling off yet. These are
[10350.40s -> 10356.88s]  our land use applications. If anything, the only thing that's happening is that the developers are
[10356.88s -> 10364.08s]  waiting for the restrictions to be lifted so they can go back to work and go back to work on things
[10364.08s -> 10370.00s]  that are already in the pipeline. Those departments are busy. Nick, to your point that they might fall
[10370.00s -> 10375.92s]  off in the future, they might not. I don't know, but right now they're busy. They're looking at a
[10375.92s -> 10384.80s]  summer that is, if it holds, is almost as busy as it was last year when they got so far behind
[10384.80s -> 10390.72s]  in putting building permits into the computer that they were 90 days late on that stuff. They were
[10390.72s -> 10396.88s]  issuing the permits that they were holding up CEOs and other things because, and this is why the
[10396.88s -> 10401.92s]  overtime went up because you have to bring people in to do that. So we're kind of rolling the dice.
[10401.92s -> 10408.16s]  I hear what you're saying. Maybe it'll drop off. Maybe the developers will say there's not enough
[10408.16s -> 10413.52s]  money in the pipeline to do this, but I can't make that prediction. So I just, if you want to hold
[10413.52s -> 10419.20s]  off a meeting to think about it, that's your decision and I understand it, but don't think you're
[10419.20s -> 10425.52s]  going to find any big numbers out of the department. That's just not going to happen. I wish I could give
[10425.68s -> 10430.56s]  you something, but we go through this every week with me and Bob and Brad and the department.
[10431.84s -> 10439.44s]  Thank you. That's all. Lisa Berg is physically waving. Excuse me, the zoom.
[10442.96s -> 10448.96s]  Dan, okay. Been patiently listening and when it got to the part of the town department
[10448.96s -> 10454.88s]  heads and stuff, I had to say, that's right. We have been having meetings every twice a week.
[10456.56s -> 10464.56s]  My issue is that normally my budget's pretty flat. I don't increase anything with this new COVID-19.
[10464.56s -> 10470.00s]  The Secretary of State has now issued us a notice that they will be mailing out absentee
[10470.00s -> 10476.72s]  valid applications to every registered Republican and Democrat for the primary, which has been put
[10476.72s -> 10482.00s]  off to June 2nd. With that being said, with people going to they're not going to want to go to
[10482.00s -> 10489.04s]  the poll, I will have to pay 65 cents to mail each and every ballot plus it costs another 50 cents
[10489.04s -> 10496.08s]  for the ballot. So for each ballot we mail out, that's a huge increase for just my budget alone.
[10496.08s -> 10503.76s]  And we have been discussing how each department head could cut. And I've heard from many other
[10503.76s -> 10511.68s]  department heads, we're pretty right where we have to be. And I'm a pretty frugal person,
[10511.68s -> 10518.32s]  but this is scary because this is something that I've never had to even anticipate doing voting
[10518.32s -> 10525.36s]  by mail. And that's a huge increase to my election account. And I can't process for November,
[10525.36s -> 10530.64s]  if this is what we're going to be doing, voting by mail, 12,000 ballots with three people.
[10531.44s -> 10536.96s]  So these are all things moving forward in the next budget season that are things that have to
[10536.96s -> 10544.00s]  be considered as well, the effects of this virus on our budgets in terms of headed expense, not just
[10544.00s -> 10553.12s]  saving. So that's all I had to say. I guess I maybe try to summarize all of that with a question
[10553.12s -> 10561.44s]  to Bob Kay and I think we know the answer, but what you're telling us is there really are no
[10561.44s -> 10571.52s]  savings. You don't see any savings from current world as impacting the fiscal 2020 budget.
[10572.88s -> 10578.72s]  No, in fact, talking to the different department as the meeting that Matt had mentioned,
[10578.72s -> 10582.48s]  I mean, they all talk about additional expenses that they're going to be incurring.
[10583.12s -> 10589.20s]  Not savings. I mean, there are some savings, but it seems like the expenses are more prominent
[10589.20s -> 10594.88s]  than the savings are especially going into next year. You know, like Matt had said, I mean,
[10596.00s -> 10600.80s]  the building department and planning, they're planning on a big second and third quarter.
[10601.76s -> 10607.84s]  I know, I know nobody has a crystal ball, but that's what it looks like when Lisa just said,
[10608.72s -> 10616.96s]  you know, as far as, you know, having to send up the ballots and then maybe have additional
[10616.96s -> 10621.84s]  help in order to sort those when they come back in. I mean, it's something we've never gone through
[10621.84s -> 10630.64s]  before. So take the point. I think what we're hearing from a few of the members is to the extent
[10630.64s -> 10637.12s]  there were savings. That could take the place of additional cuts and that might be something that
[10637.12s -> 10644.72s]  gets somebody from a position of question to a mess. So I just think, I think what you're telling
[10644.72s -> 10650.24s]  us is we're not going to have that flexibility. I mean, Bob, when you look at our budget overall,
[10650.24s -> 10655.76s]  I mean, like the board of ed is 85% of the labor, and we were probably pretty close to that. Maybe
[10655.76s -> 10661.12s]  a little bit less because we've got the benefits and the debt service, you know, but yeah, I mean,
[10662.08s -> 10668.00s]  there's going around a town hall. I go around in my mind just, you know, from one side to the
[10668.00s -> 10676.40s]  other. There's no major cuts that I could see any savings that I could see. I think Wendy,
[10677.12s -> 10684.08s]  Brian, that's kind of a response, right, to just whether they are savings or not. We are at 10 o'clock,
[10684.08s -> 10688.72s]  which, like we mean, we should recess to come back tomorrow to go through this list.
[10688.88s -> 10696.08s]  But it would be for purposes of going through this list, not necessarily sort of saving savings.
[10700.08s -> 10707.04s]  Nick asked to be unmuted. Thank you. I'm good right now. Thank you. Okay.
[10708.64s -> 10713.12s]  I also noticed in the comment. There's a lot of good comments I see from Nick. I'm assuming that's
[10713.12s -> 10717.04s]  Nick Hoffman from Greg, who I don't have, and Bill Hillman,
[10717.76s -> 10724.40s]  pertains to what the agencies do. I'd be happy to talk to anybody about that. From my personal life,
[10724.40s -> 10728.96s]  I've got a lot of experience with working at the rating agencies, but to the extent people have
[10728.96s -> 10739.36s]  additional perspectives, I think we'd love to hear that. My perspective, in my work environment,
[10739.36s -> 10745.52s]  we've, to Bob Case Point, tried to be very, very clean from how the rating agencies would
[10745.52s -> 10752.56s]  about our operations. But again, to the extent Nick or Greg or Bill, you have some other view,
[10753.60s -> 10765.04s]  we'd love to hear that. With all that said, before I make the motion, I'll ask the Board
[10765.04s -> 10774.16s]  of Finance Members, how do folks think about recently, tonight, coming back tomorrow night,
[10774.72s -> 10782.48s]  to go through the list? What today's what? Today's Tuesday? We want to come back tomorrow night,
[10782.48s -> 10789.44s]  or Thursday. I wait for Thursday, just to give a day between, you know,
[10789.44s -> 10793.52s]  you know, pink and stuff. I'm going to go sideways now, Nick.
[10797.04s -> 10802.16s]  I'm okay because everybody's stuck home, but I'm not sure there's enough time to post an
[10802.16s -> 10806.56s]  agenda for a seven o'clock meeting tomorrow. So, we can't do a meeting tomorrow.
[10807.04s -> 10814.72s]  You're recess. It's not recessed. Oh, just keep this meeting going. I got you. Yeah.
[10814.72s -> 10828.80s]  Yeah. I'm not going out either. I do like the idea of perhaps maybe having a night in between
[10828.80s -> 10834.64s]  to think about it, but I am more than happy to go with the masses, you know, but I do think that,
[10834.64s -> 10838.32s]  you know, there's stuff that we need to think about. Bob K.
[10840.32s -> 10844.96s]  I'm here. Either night is fine with me. The on coordinator extraordinaire.
[10846.16s -> 10851.76s]  My son turns 18 tomorrow. I really like to be able to celebrate with him.
[10851.76s -> 10855.28s]  I could do it. I can say thank him. Thank you.
[10855.28s -> 10860.24s]  Yeah, and many four people that consent to him. I know. We got a home choir. Yeah.
[10860.72s -> 10862.24s]  I would know. I would know.
[10862.24s -> 10865.52s]  Robert and Brian, whether they want to go tomorrow night or Thursday.
[10866.80s -> 10872.72s]  No, guys made me come on my birthday. I will grant you on her son's 18th birthday party.
[10872.72s -> 10878.08s]  And you know, what Brian, if it was my birthday, I would never even mention it. But since it's
[10878.08s -> 10882.96s]  just, I'm fine. I'm fine with that. We find out somehow. Brian, is today your birthday?
[10883.84s -> 10890.00s]  No, no, February, it's on to my birthday. Oh, sorry. I think I've actually been
[10890.00s -> 10896.72s]  to a meeting on my birthday before. Robert, Robert, I'm fine with Thursday.
[10896.72s -> 10899.68s]  I'll use tomorrow night to think about what it was like when I was 18.
[10900.88s -> 10904.48s]  Exactly. Yeah, in quarantine with your parents.
[10907.28s -> 10913.44s]  Captain, a small boat with that. I guess it's a motion to recesseless until Thursday at 7 p.m.
[10920.96s -> 10925.36s]  All right. We are recessed until Thursday at 7 p.m.
[10926.00s -> 10930.80s]  And you'll just redo this Zoom thing. Yes.
[10933.68s -> 10937.76s]  All right. Thank you, Dion, for creating this whole thing. Yeah.
[10937.76s -> 10941.68s]  And thank you all. Thank you. Thanks for ice, guys. Appreciate it.
[10943.28s -> 10944.16s]  Have a good night.
[10944.80s -> 10950.48s]  Good night. Good night. So we just keep meeting and then we're done, right?
[10950.48s -> 10953.92s]  No, and thank you for everybody that participated.
[10956.72s -> 10959.60s]  Thank you, Dion. Bye.
