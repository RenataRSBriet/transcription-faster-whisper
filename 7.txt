[0.00s -> 6.80s]  my computer. And to get this party started. So with that, my name is Melissa Wigel,
[6.80s -> 12.88s]  Director Kishan Monti, and the Linwood Watkins hierarchy organization, Keith Fonseca,
[13.60s -> 18.08s]  to give this man a little street cred, he just assured with us, he's just under the, I think,
[18.08s -> 22.80s]  it was 350 or 350, and I couldn't hear you Keith. In terms of...
[22.80s -> 25.36s]  So rather you said 50, but it was 350.
[25.36s -> 34.40s]  I thought it was. He's at the $315,000 APV mark on his own pen. So that is not including,
[34.40s -> 38.88s]  I don't believe his organization, that's his sole pen that he has written for the year.
[38.88s -> 44.00s]  And he has done, I think, almost 100% of this via Zoom meetings. I mean, I'm sure you've had
[44.00s -> 50.32s]  a few random in-person, but almost 100% of that has been done via Zoom. His entire master
[50.32s -> 56.80s]  organization, along with Ryan Federico, is just on the brink of hitting their $1 million mark.
[56.80s -> 61.04s]  So they're going to be hitting that. They just started this two years ago. You're going to get to
[61.04s -> 66.16s]  hear Keith's story, but he's really... They've accomplished a lot of this basically in about the
[66.16s -> 73.04s]  last 12 to 18 months. So they're on a very hot and fast and quick-paced run. Keith does a lot
[73.04s -> 79.68s]  of amazing things for Symmetry in general. He does a ton of depth-free life. He's hosted our
[79.68s -> 86.24s]  conference. He's an MC. He's a DJ. He's kind of the jack of all trades, and he does all facets
[86.24s -> 92.32s]  extremely well, right? And he looks really intelligent. The glass is on, so we like to see that look.
[92.32s -> 98.72s]  He has a ton of fun and likes to get stepped on, and he was more than willing to share,
[98.72s -> 104.08s]  and core into all of our organizations today. So you'll see on the right-hand side,
[104.08s -> 109.68s]  he has posted several different items in the chat. So if you want to scroll up, make sure
[110.48s -> 116.80s]  to copy those four links. And then I did already post in our Slack under General
[116.80s -> 120.88s]  Announcements, and he emailed it to Kia, but I posted under the General Announcements,
[120.88s -> 126.72s]  his new or his version of the script. I think it's Ryan's actual Ryan Federico's version of the
[126.80s -> 132.48s]  Zoom phone script. So just make sure to be looking out for those, and this is going to be recorded,
[132.48s -> 138.24s]  and I will post that as well in Slack. And so we just want to say with a full heart of gratitude,
[138.24s -> 143.04s]  Keith, we're extremely elated to have you on our call. We love your energy. We love you,
[143.04s -> 147.60s]  and you almost don't even need an introduction because everybody knows you. They see you on the
[147.60s -> 152.96s]  national call. He's one of our biggest depth-free life writers, so we're just really appreciative
[152.96s -> 156.64s]  of you being on the call, Keith. And I look forward to hearing from you. So I'll give it to you,
[156.64s -> 164.00s]  buddy. Thank you so much, Melissa. Thank you, everybody, for being here. I know Kia said,
[164.00s -> 167.76s]  I'm going to have a lot to teach you. I don't know that I'll have a lot to teach you,
[167.76s -> 172.16s]  but I'll certainly share with you the symmetry system that has helped me get to where I'm at.
[173.12s -> 179.28s]  My name is Keith Fonseca, direct to my best friend and business partner, Ryan Federico.
[180.24s -> 186.40s]  So, so grateful to be partnered up with someone I know who would show up anywhere any time for me.
[187.04s -> 192.96s]  And I'm so grateful to be at Symmetry Financial Group. Many of you have heard my story. I went on
[192.96s -> 198.32s]  the national call and talked a little bit about I have no business being at Symmetry.
[198.96s -> 204.96s]  I really, there was a time where not no business being anywhere. And certainly that has turned
[204.96s -> 211.68s]  around since I've come to Symmetry. You may have heard Ryan mentioned that, and again,
[211.68s -> 218.96s]  I'm so blessed and grateful that he said this, that I'm all the proof he'll ever need that this thing
[218.96s -> 227.36s]  works. And we'll get into why he said that. But there's a couple of things I want to do first and
[227.36s -> 234.40s]  touch on. First of all, forgive me if we do, we're going to try to stick to 60 minutes. If we do
[234.40s -> 242.32s]  slide across it, it's only because I love doing this. And I would rather nobody left this meeting,
[242.32s -> 247.28s]  feeling like they didn't take something away, or that you couldn't be any better at this business
[247.28s -> 254.40s]  with Zoom. So the first thing I want to jump into is there's a number of people on this call that
[254.40s -> 261.52s]  means so much to me, both at Symmetry and personally. It'll be challenging for me to name names,
[262.24s -> 267.12s]  but I'd be remiss if I didn't say thank you to Kia Bailey for this invite and for this opportunity
[267.68s -> 274.08s]  at a Melissa Weagle. I just said this, I'll say this proudly. Outside of Ryan Federico and Edward
[274.08s -> 278.72s]  Purchit, I don't think there's anybody at Symmetry has taught me more about being a professional
[278.72s -> 284.72s]  at Symmetry than Melissa Weagle. And I'm super grateful to have her mentorship. I love Mark Hamilton
[284.72s -> 291.04s]  dearly. I will say that publicly in front of all you. He's one of my very best friends in this world.
[291.04s -> 296.24s]  And I've got to know a number of you in this organization that was grateful to be a part of raising
[296.24s -> 306.16s]  $5,000 for the Make a Wish Foundation. I'm part of many agencies and organizations and hierarchies
[306.16s -> 311.28s]  and none of them. Well, that's not true. We went and golfed in Pennsylvania and we raised about
[311.28s -> 320.08s]  10,000. But for that group and that room to put together $5,000 for that little girl who came that day
[320.08s -> 325.68s]  and that organization was truly, truly special. If I don't remember anything about that conference,
[325.68s -> 329.76s]  you know, it was that moment when she stood on stage and tears rolled down her face.
[330.56s -> 336.08s]  And so before we really get into the material, I want to do a little exercise here.
[336.72s -> 344.80s]  I'm going to play a video. It is from Brian Delaney. It is from my Facebook page. So if you see
[344.80s -> 348.72s]  anything from my Facebook, just ignore it. It's your hallucination.
[352.80s -> 358.56s]  Can you see that properly, Melissa? All right, let me just check and make sure I did the sound. No.
[362.08s -> 364.56s]  All right, five minute video from Brian Delaney. Here we go.
[365.52s -> 380.96s]  Okay, so let's talk about what we do and why the numbers we're about to talk about are important.
[383.36s -> 391.44s]  Who in here has recently heard from a family you've called a lead within the last month where
[391.52s -> 399.60s]  the person who has who sent in the lead or the person's spouse who sent in the lead has passed away.
[400.72s -> 405.68s]  Right. There's, you know, about 50% of the room. A little bit less than that.
[406.56s -> 413.12s]  That's why we do what we do. We're not, we're not in the business of, we're not in the business
[413.12s -> 418.64s]  of preventing death. We're in the business of planning for it and helping people who haven't saved
[418.64s -> 424.16s]  for it, getting to a really great position where they can appropriately agree for their family
[424.16s -> 430.08s]  rather than thinking about the finances. Okay, the question we answer is what are you going to be
[430.08s -> 436.24s]  thinking about when your spouse passes away? Are you going to be thinking about the next bills that
[436.24s -> 440.56s]  are coming up? When you're at that funeral, are you going to be thinking about bills? Are you going
[440.56s -> 445.76s]  to be thinking about how am I going to make it? Are you going to be thinking about what the next
[445.76s -> 450.56s]  thing that needs to come out? Is your mind going to be on the finances? Or is your mind going to
[450.56s -> 456.40s]  be on celebrating this person's life that you've loved so well and that has been with you for so
[456.40s -> 461.44s]  long? Right. This life partner because we never, we never take away the pain, but we can take
[461.44s -> 466.16s]  care of the financial fear. And that's what we help people do on a regular basis. We help people do
[466.16s -> 471.60s]  that by simply not looking at our leads as leads. We look at them as families who have asked for help.
[471.60s -> 478.72s]  These are pleas from people pleading for us to be able to get in front of them, to have the courage
[478.72s -> 482.72s]  to not look to them for the confidence that we're doing a good job, but to walk in knowing
[482.72s -> 486.24s]  there is not a single person they could sit with who's going to think about their family,
[486.24s -> 492.00s]  who's going to care more about them or complete the commitments that we made to those families.
[492.00s -> 496.88s]  Nobody's going to be able to do that better than me. Right. And that's why we get paid well for what
[496.88s -> 501.76s]  we do is because we don't need other people to tell us we're doing a good job. We walk in with
[501.76s -> 506.00s]  the confidence that I can help this family. I'm going to help them in a way that's going to be
[506.00s -> 511.44s]  that's going to be significant and impactful. And when they call me, I'm going to be there.
[511.44s -> 516.16s]  And that's a problem in the industry is that for as many people have insurance policies,
[516.16s -> 521.04s]  they don't have an advocate to go along with those policies because that advocate is out of business
[521.04s -> 526.48s]  because the average income is 35,000 a year and the average lifespan of an agent is about 10 to 11
[527.20s -> 532.08s]  months. So those people who are making the promises of I will help you when this time comes,
[532.08s -> 535.84s]  they're unable to complete those promises because they're busy taking care of their family.
[535.84s -> 541.36s]  That's the problem that SFG is here and set up to solve. We want to look at how to help people be
[541.36s -> 545.84s]  profitable and grow leadership teams in a trillion dollar industry in order to share the wealth
[545.84s -> 552.48s]  of opportunity. And that every single dollar of APV is related to a dollar plus of value that we
[552.48s -> 556.72s]  get to add to these families. And we have to know that when we get in the home and not be thinking
[556.72s -> 561.76s]  about our bank accounts and be thinking about this family, their financial future and what it can
[561.76s -> 568.48s]  look like now that we're here. How we can reimagine that with them while we're there. And to me,
[568.48s -> 574.32s]  there is nothing that's more valuable than that. Being able to help people have these conversations,
[574.32s -> 578.48s]  emotionally support them through these conversations, not in order to get a sale, but in order to
[578.48s -> 584.24s]  help them protect their family the exact way they would have wanted to and what they qualify for
[584.24s -> 589.60s]  when they sent in the form. So that's what we get to do. And if you lose that passion, I promise you,
[589.60s -> 594.88s]  you will be powerless on the phone. That is one thing that I know. You will be powerless on the phone
[594.88s -> 600.56s]  because you will hesitate. You will hesitate when they, when I talked about Tory and I a little while
[600.56s -> 606.80s]  ago going into a furniture store, right? First thing we do when we go up to furniture piece we like.
[606.96s -> 617.52s]  We knock on it. Why do we knock on it? To see if it's real, right? And sometimes when we're on the phone,
[617.52s -> 624.88s]  the client goes like this and we panic. Because we didn't understand that they only do that to
[624.88s -> 628.96s]  pieces of furniture to things that they like and appreciate and they're just trying to figure out
[628.96s -> 636.00s]  if they can trust it, right? And so don't let your fear turn something that is solid into something
[636.00s -> 640.88s]  that is hollow, right? So when we're talking about APV today, that's what we're really talking about.
[640.88s -> 645.52s]  We're not talking about commissions paid. Commissions get paid when we add value. No question about that.
[645.52s -> 649.36s]  That's how this industry works, right? We're not talking about the commissions we're going to get paid.
[649.36s -> 654.40s]  We're talking about the value that we add first and the inevitable great result that happens for us
[654.40s -> 659.84s]  second after it happens for the family's first.
[666.48s -> 673.92s]  Okay,
[676.48s -> 680.48s]  anybody feeling a little moved by what they just heard and saw?
[683.92s -> 689.68s]  What was the last time we asked ourselves, why am I doing this?
[693.20s -> 694.08s]  Why am I doing this?
[696.00s -> 701.44s]  Why do I put myself through what is the apparent torture of dialing and getting rejected?
[703.04s -> 707.52s]  Why do I meet with another family to help protect them
[709.44s -> 714.72s]  when they just see me as a salesman, a salesperson, a saleswoman? They just,
[716.48s -> 718.32s]  they don't see why I'm really here.
[718.40s -> 725.28s]  Put two hands up if you can hear me right now.
[728.48s -> 730.40s]  I want to see all three screens.
[734.32s -> 740.48s]  No, I didn't say raise the roof, Michelle Flanagan. I said, put two hands up. If you could really hear,
[741.20s -> 746.08s]  can you hear my heart beating? It's racing right now. Can you feel your own?
[749.28s -> 754.72s]  Like just think about what Delaney's talking about. Somebody today is going, you can put your hands
[754.72s -> 761.12s]  down. Someone today is going to, oh wow, this is like recess. Put your hands up. I didn't say
[761.12s -> 770.48s]  Simon says, someone today is going to lose their best friend. Maybe it's you.
[770.48s -> 776.32s]  Just stop and think about that.
[780.32s -> 790.48s]  Now, how many of you right now realize that we're on video and we're not sitting together?
[794.56s -> 796.80s]  Right, you realize that, but do you feel different?
[797.76s -> 799.60s]  Like, can you feel what I'm talking about?
[802.32s -> 807.52s]  Do you feel a little bit emotionally moved about the topic and the reason that you're here?
[811.36s -> 813.04s]  What about uncomfortable silence?
[821.68s -> 826.08s]  What normally happens when there's uncomfortable silence? We start to reflect.
[827.28s -> 831.52s]  We start to think. We start to feel.
[833.60s -> 838.72s]  What do I bring this up? Right, there are a number of us on this call that do not like to feel.
[841.36s -> 849.68s]  And yet, you are in a feelings business. This is 100% an emotional sale
[850.48s -> 858.24s]  and anybody that I have ever known that attempted to create a purchase over video
[859.36s -> 865.52s]  about mortgage protection, right? And Melissa mentioned debt-free life. And let me tell you,
[865.52s -> 872.88s]  debt-free life is about 45% of my business, not all of it. But anybody who's tried to create
[872.88s -> 880.96s]  an opportunity for someone to buy over video without feelings might as well, and you may not
[880.96s -> 886.16s]  like hearing this, go to select a quote. Just go to select a quote.
[888.48s -> 892.48s]  When I start an appointment and someone tells me I'm here for quotes, I tell them, well,
[893.60s -> 899.68s]  that's not why I'm here. I apologize. You probably should have gone to Google and Google Life
[899.68s -> 910.00s]  Insurance Prices. I tell them that. Here is why most people have trouble on the phone and why
[910.00s -> 917.84s]  most people have trouble in Zoom and Brian Delaney said it. He said it. He said, when they knock,
[920.24s -> 927.76s]  what's the knock? I didn't fill that card out. What's the knock? Oh, I don't have time for this.
[930.00s -> 939.52s]  Right? What's really the knock? Most people respond in fear. I don't know if you expected to come to
[939.52s -> 946.80s]  this training to talk about fear, but this is really 100% about fear. And that's what I had to
[946.80s -> 951.60s]  learn in my journey. So, you know, Kia asked me to share a little bit about my journey because
[951.60s -> 958.96s]  there are a number of you who are probably not going to make it in this business. And that's sad
[958.96s -> 962.96s]  and disappointing. And the reason you won't make it in this business because you're going to make
[962.96s -> 971.12s]  the one mistake that people make a symmetry financial group. You're going to quit. And I sat
[971.84s -> 980.08s]  in a Zoom meeting one time with Edward Pritchett who said, if you quit, you're a dummy.
[982.88s -> 988.72s]  What did he just say to people? He's like, you own a business. You have a franchise.
[989.36s -> 996.08s]  We have a recipe and it works. So, if you quit, you're a dummy.
[999.20s -> 1005.52s]  Now, I don't personally care to call anyone personally a dummy, but just so I'm clear,
[1007.20s -> 1015.20s]  don't be a dummy. Don't quit. Do not quit. That's the one mistake you can make.
[1015.60s -> 1021.12s]  And there are all kinds of reasons that we go there. I mean, typically it's, I don't have
[1021.12s -> 1028.48s]  money for leads. The leads don't work. My mentor is not calling me. My team is terrible.
[1030.96s -> 1034.48s]  Name them. So, here's my quick story.
[1038.08s -> 1045.04s]  In 2016, I was sitting in a chair in my $2,000 a month apartment in southern California.
[1046.16s -> 1054.16s]  And I was doing design and design for construction for outdoor remodel.
[1054.64s -> 1060.64s]  I was selling that. It was my third month in. And I was salesman of the month. I had written
[1060.64s -> 1067.12s]  about $300,000 in construction business, made about 30 grand. And they were naming me salesman
[1067.12s -> 1071.04s]  of the month on August 5, 2016. And I was sitting in my
[1071.68s -> 1078.08s]  Ottoman just waiting for my appointment. And my younger brother called me and he was screaming
[1078.08s -> 1081.92s]  and it was yelling, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. So, I started talking
[1081.92s -> 1089.12s]  through CPR and one and two and three and four. Usually when I do this exercise and I tell
[1089.12s -> 1093.92s]  the story, I start to cry because I go right back to that moment where my younger brother passed
[1093.92s -> 1099.36s]  away on the phone, 3,000 miles away from where I was sitting. And I heard the police coming in
[1099.36s -> 1108.40s]  pronouncing it all. I tell that story on every appointment.
[1112.80s -> 1120.08s]  So after that happened, he left me some money. We found Symmetry Financial Group and we started.
[1120.08s -> 1124.40s]  And in my first like nine months or so, I really didn't do much of anything. I just kind of
[1124.40s -> 1129.12s]  pretended to recruit. Really what I did was play three hours of basketball the day and hang out
[1129.12s -> 1135.92s]  my apartment. That was it. And so then I realized like I wasn't being a leader, I wasn't being an
[1135.92s -> 1141.84s]  example and I was going to run out of money. So I started going into the field but I didn't really
[1141.84s -> 1147.44s]  believe in what I was doing. And remind me Melissa, I have an audio from SoundCloud that I need to
[1147.44s -> 1153.28s]  upload to the group. It's a call to the leader talking about the two things that eliminate people that
[1153.28s -> 1159.52s]  force people to quit in this business. Well, it's one thing. It's insecurity. This is why Symmetry
[1159.52s -> 1164.72s]  focuses so much. And sorry if I jump around, it's just kind of my head. It's insecurity. This
[1164.72s -> 1172.32s]  why Symmetry focuses so much on personal development. It's because insecurity is born of two things.
[1172.32s -> 1178.16s]  A lack of confidence and a lack of belief. If I am not confident enough and I don't believe,
[1178.88s -> 1184.48s]  right, then I'm insecure. And if I'm insecure, the second you knock on me and you don't trust me
[1184.48s -> 1190.56s]  or don't believe me, I run. I run in fear. Because now all of a sudden you're going to figure out
[1190.56s -> 1196.40s]  that I'm insecure and I don't like feeling this way. I also don't like the fact that you have now
[1196.40s -> 1206.64s]  exposed me. So I tell that story on every Zoom because it's an emotional time. And I do what
[1207.12s -> 1216.32s]  Casey Watkins says, let the silence do the work. Let the silence do the work. I do this thing
[1216.32s -> 1223.12s]  called a pregnant pause. Notice how I keep doing it. And every time I do it, I can see the screen
[1223.12s -> 1229.60s]  of people looking back at me like, what's he going to say next? And I can see you like sort of
[1230.80s -> 1236.00s]  being engaged. And then there are some of you I can see that are doing other work while we're
[1236.00s -> 1243.28s]  doing this. Not particularly listening. And I would and some of you are not on video. And I
[1243.28s -> 1250.72s]  would suggest if you plan on being good at Zoom and engaging with other folks, then you should
[1250.72s -> 1257.76s]  practice every time you're on Zoom engaging with other folks. And that does not come with not being
[1257.76s -> 1264.80s]  on video or doing other things while we're on video, right? Just keep in mind I just told you my
[1264.88s -> 1271.04s]  brother died, wrecked my world. And some of you are typing away doing other shit.
[1276.32s -> 1283.60s]  Anybody feel what I just said? Okay, this is how you have success over Zoom. They have to feel
[1283.60s -> 1291.20s]  you. They have to feel like you're sitting there with them. It is so important. So to continue my
[1291.20s -> 1296.56s]  story, I'm going to keep an eye on the clock because I'll just go for four hours here. To continue my
[1296.56s -> 1303.12s]  story, three months I went in the field, and I just kept getting rejected. No one would buy for me.
[1304.24s -> 1312.56s]  And finally, Ryan said to me, no, excuse me, I stopped at a CVS. I was crying. I called Ryan.
[1312.56s -> 1317.44s]  I said, I quit this business. It's just not for me. I give up. And Ryan, like a good friend,
[1317.44s -> 1323.92s]  said to me, it's okay. You can quit. I love you no matter what. But I believe you can be the
[1323.92s -> 1329.76s]  number one writer at Symmetry Financial Group. That's what you told me. And I was like, hey man,
[1329.76s -> 1336.56s]  did you just hear what I just said? I quit. I was like, yeah, I heard you. I believe you can be the
[1336.56s -> 1344.40s]  number one writer at Symmetry Financial Group. Now, let this be recorded. I believe that I am sitting
[1344.40s -> 1350.72s]  amongst the number one writer at Symmetry Financial Group next year. And it's not me.
[1352.96s -> 1360.56s]  There's somebody on this call in this video who can be number one next year. But you can't quit.
[1362.00s -> 1365.04s]  Because if you quit, that will definitely never happen.
[1365.76s -> 1376.24s]  So, how did this transformation take place? It was a series of input from folks,
[1378.00s -> 1387.92s]  different trainings. But realistically, I had to make a decision on was I going to go 100%
[1387.92s -> 1392.88s]  all in? Now, what does that mean? A lot of you are sort of looking at me and thinking,
[1393.52s -> 1402.72s]  I am 100% all in, dude. I've sold my pets. I've auctioned myself off to go paint other
[1402.72s -> 1409.52s]  people's house. What else can I really do? There's nothing you can do financially,
[1409.52s -> 1419.04s]  monetarily, or physically to change how you come off in a Zoom appointment. It only comes from here
[1419.20s -> 1429.20s]  and here. So, if you have a pen, write this down. I do not listen with my ears.
[1431.76s -> 1441.20s]  I listen with my heart. I do not listen with my ears. I listen with my heart.
[1442.48s -> 1446.00s]  If you don't feel connected to them, they will not feel connected to you.
[1449.60s -> 1455.92s]  That is extremely important. And if you are not attempting to connect with them,
[1456.80s -> 1461.28s]  then you might as well just end the Zoom and not even bother. Or just get there,
[1461.28s -> 1465.68s]  present prices two minutes later. Have them tell you they need to think about it and then take off.
[1467.44s -> 1473.76s]  Now, if you want strategies on how to ask for the business and get them to engage with that,
[1473.76s -> 1478.96s]  no problem. We've posted the training that Ryan and I did in the chat box there.
[1479.92s -> 1485.20s]  It's on Vimeo. You can go watch it. It's about an hour long. It's called asking for the business
[1485.20s -> 1493.76s]  six or more times. And it works. And the number one thing that comes out of that is called assumption.
[1493.76s -> 1503.84s]  Assumption. I assume that Brooke Learner is writing this so vehemently that she's going to remember
[1503.84s -> 1512.40s]  this and go back over her notes. Look at that. Beautiful. I assume those of you that are listening
[1512.40s -> 1517.52s]  and paying attention are going to go back over this vehemently and remember the notes.
[1518.08s -> 1524.88s]  What is the way to get better at assumption? What is the way to get better at vulnerability and
[1524.88s -> 1532.72s]  connection? Well, if you haven't picked up Miranda Martin's book, the Ultimate Sales Training Guide,
[1532.72s -> 1537.52s]  written by a symmetry partner for symmetry people, she says in there,
[1538.00s -> 1548.08s]  you remember a five percent of what you hear. Then it goes, and the bottom one is you remember 90 percent
[1548.08s -> 1555.68s]  of what you teach. So, I know in the wiggle organization, we have accountability partners.
[1556.64s -> 1562.96s]  I'm sure we do something in the Bailey organization. Start looking up the info to teach it.
[1562.96s -> 1571.52s]  Start teaching family members how to connect with you. Start teaching accountability partners
[1572.16s -> 1581.20s]  how you're feeling over zoom. Right? So, I've been talking about vulnerability. I would say
[1581.20s -> 1586.16s]  that Godmother and Vulnerability is this woman named Brunei Brown. Read her books.
[1587.12s -> 1593.84s]  Darren Grayley is one of my personal favorites reading it now. And she just put an article out in
[1593.84s -> 1599.92s]  Forbes talking about how people don't connect on zoom. So, we're going to do a little exercise
[1599.92s -> 1607.68s]  that Brunei Brown suggested. I want you right now in the chat box to type two words that describe
[1607.76s -> 1615.84s]  how you're feeling. Not what you're doing, not what you're thinking. You cannot use the word
[1615.84s -> 1623.52s]  like something. It has to actually be a feeling, right? I'm feeling hungry and cold, motivated,
[1623.52s -> 1632.56s]  excited, pumped, encouraged, involved, engaged, active, good. Send them in.
[1637.92s -> 1646.72s]  Okay, here's my next question as they come in. How many of you when you type those feelings?
[1647.92s -> 1655.04s]  We're concerned that someone was going to read it. Right? Just think about that.
[1657.52s -> 1663.36s]  Is this truly Tim B. Croft? Can you unmute Tim?
[1663.36s -> 1671.52s]  Yeah. There you are. Hey, buddy. What did you type in?
[1672.72s -> 1677.04s]  Motivated and anxious. Who are you directive?
[1677.92s -> 1680.80s]  Melanie Ray. Who's she directive?
[1681.44s -> 1687.60s]  Keith Bailey. So you're in the Bailey organization. Welcome, Tim. Do you know why I picked you?
[1687.84s -> 1697.52s]  No, and I didn't have my video on before. I didn't notice there's three pages of people,
[1697.52s -> 1702.32s]  so I can't tell whose video is not on. Although I saw Alyssa Gonzalez with her video off,
[1702.32s -> 1709.84s]  and I was like, this can't happen. Come on now. I love Alyssa. I picked you, Tim, because you wrote
[1709.84s -> 1716.56s]  you were motivated and anxious. First thing I want to thank you for being honest. There are a ton of
[1716.56s -> 1722.48s]  people who wrote in the box and we're not being honest. They just wrote stuff. They think I want to
[1722.48s -> 1729.12s]  hear. They think everybody wants to hear. Right? Right now, I'm feeling inadequate. I don't know how
[1729.12s -> 1734.40s]  this training is going. I don't know what effect it's having on people, but I'm honest and vulnerable
[1734.40s -> 1741.84s]  enough to tell all 71 of you that I feel inadequate. And it's okay. Why are you feeling anxious, Tim?
[1741.84s -> 1751.92s]  That is my first week. I just bought leads. And I guess I'm just anxious to set appointments.
[1753.04s -> 1755.76s]  Okay. What do you think is going to happen with that set of leads?
[1760.72s -> 1766.64s]  I think I'm going to try and learn from it. I'm going to fail. Definitely not going to be
[1767.60s -> 1773.36s]  perfect at it first. It's definitely going to be something I've got to work at.
[1775.12s -> 1780.16s]  I can sense your trepidation, and I can appreciate it because I was definitely there.
[1781.84s -> 1787.28s]  There are days that I'm still there. Why are you doing this, Tim?
[1789.76s -> 1793.28s]  To provide a better living for myself and my girlfriend?
[1794.16s -> 1795.28s]  Why is that important to you?
[1800.56s -> 1806.32s]  I mean, just kind of need it going forward to create a better lifestyle.
[1808.32s -> 1813.52s]  To better myself as a person. Provide a better life for my future family.
[1814.80s -> 1818.96s]  That's amazing, Tim. Nothing could be more noble with that. You know that, right?
[1819.12s -> 1828.80s]  Now, let me ask you this. If you don't make the dials and you don't get active,
[1830.40s -> 1834.32s]  do you think your family will be able to support itself without you, without that?
[1835.60s -> 1839.68s]  No. So we should probably get active and make the dials, right?
[1841.44s -> 1844.96s]  Definitely. Okay. Thank you for participating, Tim.
[1845.12s -> 1847.12s]  Yeah.
[1848.08s -> 1851.52s]  Shake your hands if you appreciate Tim's honesty and vulnerability, please.
[1852.64s -> 1854.80s]  You see everybody, Tim? Yep.
[1855.60s -> 1857.68s]  You've been here a week and you're loved or anywhere.
[1859.76s -> 1861.60s]  You know that, right? Yeah.
[1862.64s -> 1866.40s]  I'm going to personally give you my phone number. I'm not giving it to everybody,
[1866.40s -> 1870.96s]  but I'm going to give it to you just for participating. Let's work together.
[1871.92s -> 1873.36s]  Yeah. Sounds good.
[1873.84s -> 1880.48s]  All right, man. I love that smile, too. Okay. I'm not sure if you guys thank you, Tim.
[1880.48s -> 1884.24s]  I'm not sure if you guys understood what happened there, right?
[1885.68s -> 1890.96s]  A couple of things. First, we got to connect. I feel like Tim and I are best friends now.
[1891.60s -> 1895.92s]  And just by watching, I don't know if you felt the closeness of that conversation.
[1896.88s -> 1901.20s]  Secondly, getting back into assumption, right?
[1901.68s -> 1905.12s]  I'm going to assume that Tim's going to answer my questions honestly,
[1906.00s -> 1910.16s]  and I'm not going to run from the fear of asking him hard questions.
[1911.28s -> 1915.92s]  Because I don't know if anybody could sense him was a little bit on the spot,
[1916.96s -> 1919.68s]  a little bit nervous. He openly said that.
[1920.24s -> 1922.08s]  And those questions were challenging.
[1922.88s -> 1928.56s]  He isn't knowing of you. And I just asked him some pretty challenging questions about
[1928.56s -> 1934.80s]  the most important thing in his life. So I'm going to show you how to sell mortgage protection
[1934.80s -> 1935.92s]  in three questions.
[1940.00s -> 1940.80s]  Everybody ready?
[1946.24s -> 1949.84s]  Let's pick someone I don't know here. Jessica,
[1950.80s -> 1953.04s]  how do you say the last thing? Doe, Doe, Sure?
[1954.16s -> 1956.40s]  Doe, Sure. Doe, Sure. Hi, welcome.
[1956.40s -> 1959.28s]  Doe, Sure. Kind of like the reindeer, but it's felt differently.
[1959.28s -> 1961.60s]  Oh, Doe, Sure. Doe, Sure. I apologize.
[1962.08s -> 1962.88s]  That's okay.
[1962.88s -> 1965.92s]  You're in New Jersey. We pronounce Doe, Sure, and Roar, Her.
[1966.48s -> 1966.88s]  Anyways,
[1969.20s -> 1970.08s]  who are you direct to?
[1970.72s -> 1971.44s]  Kia Bailey.
[1971.92s -> 1973.04s]  Kia Bailey. Perfect.
[1974.48s -> 1977.92s]  So let me ask you a question. Like, let's pretend you're my client.
[1977.92s -> 1981.04s]  We booked a mortgage protection appointment and here you are on Zoom.
[1981.68s -> 1984.48s]  Right. We're going to back up to the show up rate in a second, but
[1985.20s -> 1986.88s]  let's pretend you're here on Zoom.
[1986.88s -> 1988.72s]  Hi, Jessica. Nice to meet you. I'm Keith.
[1989.60s -> 1992.32s]  Really excited. Thank you for coming to this meeting.
[1992.32s -> 1993.20s]  How you doing today?
[1993.92s -> 1995.60s]  I'm good. How are you?
[1996.64s -> 2003.04s]  I'm okay. It's like raining on and off every day here in New Jersey.
[2003.04s -> 2005.44s]  It's really like pissing me off to be honest with you.
[2005.44s -> 2008.72s]  Because I want to like feel excited with the sunshine and I just can't.
[2008.72s -> 2009.36s]  Where do you live?
[2010.08s -> 2014.96s]  I live in Wisconsin and I actually I travel out to New Jersey quite often.
[2014.96s -> 2018.32s]  And I really love it out there. The East Coast is my favorite.
[2018.32s -> 2022.24s]  California, which is just west of Newark a little bit.
[2022.24s -> 2023.36s]  Like 30, 40 minutes.
[2024.88s -> 2028.16s]  30, 40 minutes west of Newark. You're like in another state.
[2028.88s -> 2029.68s]  Yeah, I know.
[2031.60s -> 2033.36s]  Totally out in the country.
[2033.36s -> 2035.12s]  Yeah, and I love Pennsylvania as well.
[2035.60s -> 2036.64s]  Really? Why?
[2036.64s -> 2040.96s]  Yeah. I honestly think that it's a beautiful state.
[2040.96s -> 2045.44s]  I have traveled pretty much all of Pennsylvania and truth be told.
[2046.00s -> 2048.80s]  I plan on moving out east when my kids are out of school.
[2049.76s -> 2050.24s]  Oh, what?
[2050.24s -> 2051.12s]  So how old are you kids?
[2052.72s -> 2056.08s]  17, 14, 11 and or 12 and nine.
[2057.04s -> 2058.32s]  Good, it's gracious.
[2058.32s -> 2060.16s]  You have a shotgun for that many.
[2061.04s -> 2064.40s]  I was actually a surrogate.
[2064.40s -> 2069.04s]  So that's part of the reason why I travel out to New Jersey quite often is
[2069.04s -> 2071.36s]  because I carried twins and they live out there.
[2071.36s -> 2074.88s]  So my kids and I spend their birthdays with them every year.
[2074.88s -> 2077.20s]  Like I really, really love it at least.
[2077.76s -> 2079.84s]  Amazing, absolutely amazing.
[2081.60s -> 2083.20s]  Anybody see what's going on right now?
[2085.44s -> 2087.76s]  Engaging in conversation, getting to know somebody,
[2087.76s -> 2091.12s]  connecting which is what I love.
[2091.12s -> 2091.92s]  You're smiling.
[2092.64s -> 2092.96s]  Yeah.
[2093.84s -> 2096.96s]  What I think you're like, what is about to happen?
[2098.64s -> 2101.20s]  Okay, you never know what's going to happen when you're put on the spot.
[2101.20s -> 2105.68s]  But yeah, just imagine you're that client that comes to the meeting.
[2105.68s -> 2107.68s]  They feel on the spot every single time.
[2109.68s -> 2114.64s]  And so it's our job to deconstruct that moment very quickly.
[2114.64s -> 2116.32s]  Bring it from here to here.
[2116.40s -> 2121.60s]  And it's done through questions of engagement, which most of us are afraid to do
[2121.60s -> 2124.88s]  because we fear that the other person's going to say something like,
[2124.88s -> 2125.84s]  why would you ask me that?
[2126.96s -> 2130.16s]  How dare you dive into my personal business?
[2131.12s -> 2134.40s]  I mean, you just told me that you carried surrogate twins.
[2134.40s -> 2136.08s]  It doesn't get any more personal than that.
[2137.04s -> 2138.72s]  And I'm sure it was very personal for you.
[2141.44s -> 2143.84s]  So here's my first question to you.
[2143.84s -> 2146.56s]  When you, listen, we sent you a card.
[2146.56s -> 2147.76s]  You filled it out, right?
[2148.64s -> 2151.52s]  You gave us some medical sort of info.
[2151.52s -> 2152.16s]  We called you.
[2152.16s -> 2153.04s]  We confirmed that.
[2153.76s -> 2154.72s]  We made this appointment.
[2154.72s -> 2155.60s]  And here you are.
[2155.60s -> 2156.72s]  Thank you for being here.
[2157.92s -> 2158.80s]  Let me ask you this.
[2158.80s -> 2160.08s]  When you did all that, right?
[2160.08s -> 2161.04s]  You filled out the card.
[2161.76s -> 2162.96s]  And you're here.
[2162.96s -> 2168.08s]  Now, what is your goal of what's your goal for this appointment?
[2169.04s -> 2174.88s]  I want to make sure that if I pass away unexpectedly that
[2176.32s -> 2178.16s]  my finances are taken care of,
[2178.16s -> 2180.72s]  you know, and I was standing mortgage or anything like that,
[2181.60s -> 2183.12s]  so that my family is taken care of.
[2183.12s -> 2185.60s]  That I don't have to worry about if I'm gone,
[2186.16s -> 2187.44s]  what they're going to do.
[2187.44s -> 2191.12s]  You know, will they have to hurry up and sell my estate
[2191.12s -> 2194.40s]  and worry about any unpaid bills to take care of?
[2194.40s -> 2197.12s]  So I want to make sure that they're set and protected.
[2198.08s -> 2200.00s]  So you want to make sure your family's set
[2200.00s -> 2202.48s]  and protected sounds like there will be a lot to handle
[2202.48s -> 2204.24s]  if something happened to you, right?
[2204.24s -> 2206.64s]  Is that kind of, like, you're you correctly?
[2206.64s -> 2207.44s]  Okay, cool.
[2208.48s -> 2210.96s]  Why, I mean, why is that important to you?
[2212.24s -> 2214.40s]  Because I don't want that to be a burden on my family.
[2215.20s -> 2219.04s]  You know, I don't want them to have to worry about that
[2219.04s -> 2220.08s]  and think about it.
[2220.72s -> 2223.28s]  What they're going to do, you know,
[2223.28s -> 2226.96s]  who, who has to be paid, you know,
[2227.04s -> 2228.96s]  who's the mortgage through, who's this through,
[2228.96s -> 2232.32s]  who's that through and just not have to worry about that.
[2233.12s -> 2234.08s]  Yeah, it sounds like,
[2235.68s -> 2239.20s]  you don't want that burden placed on people you love, right?
[2239.76s -> 2241.92s]  So, does that kind of mean,
[2241.92s -> 2244.40s]  if you don't put some protection in place,
[2244.40s -> 2246.88s]  this is going to be a huge burden on them.
[2246.88s -> 2250.08s]  If you should pass away or become permanently and totally disabled,
[2250.08s -> 2251.84s]  like, there would be a major burden on that.
[2252.80s -> 2253.36s]  Absolutely.
[2253.36s -> 2256.64s]  I mean, I have four kids and I'm divorced
[2256.72s -> 2259.84s]  and, you know, who, who's going to help with that.
[2260.64s -> 2261.28s]  Right.
[2261.28s -> 2263.84s]  So, we should probably put some protection in place to date.
[2264.88s -> 2265.44s]  Absolutely.
[2266.64s -> 2268.48s]  Do we just sell you a policy?
[2269.44s -> 2269.68s]  Yes.
[2270.88s -> 2271.52s]  Three questions.
[2275.12s -> 2276.80s]  What brought you here, right?
[2276.80s -> 2277.52s]  What's your goal?
[2278.88s -> 2280.32s]  Why is that important to you?
[2281.84s -> 2283.12s]  And if you don't do this,
[2283.12s -> 2286.72s]  will this really suffer them?
[2289.60s -> 2291.20s]  And then my assaulted statement out,
[2291.20s -> 2293.76s]  so we should probably put something in place today, shouldn't we?
[2295.68s -> 2296.80s]  Now, if she said no,
[2297.68s -> 2298.80s]  my follow-up is,
[2299.52s -> 2300.16s]  well, hold on.
[2300.80s -> 2301.20s]  Why not?
[2302.48s -> 2302.72s]  Right.
[2302.72s -> 2305.52s]  We just kind of theme to the agreement
[2306.00s -> 2308.56s]  that it's really important to you to protect your family.
[2309.04s -> 2311.60s]  Notice that I use the word burden over and over.
[2311.60s -> 2313.12s]  That was her word, not mine.
[2314.08s -> 2315.76s]  I'm listening, right?
[2315.76s -> 2318.56s]  I'm picking out that word, burden, burden, burden.
[2320.32s -> 2321.92s]  I'm putting it back in her court.
[2324.80s -> 2326.72s]  Most people will say yes right there.
[2327.28s -> 2330.32s]  Some people in the first question will very practically say,
[2330.32s -> 2331.44s]  I'm here for quotes.
[2332.00s -> 2333.52s]  I'm here to get education.
[2334.80s -> 2337.84s]  Here's how my reaction differs in that moment.
[2338.40s -> 2339.04s]  It doesn't.
[2340.00s -> 2341.44s]  It shouldn't.
[2343.76s -> 2345.20s]  If I'm a sumpative,
[2345.20s -> 2347.44s]  that we are writing an application today.
[2348.40s -> 2350.80s]  And I'm looking at you, and I'm speaking to you,
[2350.80s -> 2352.80s]  like we're writing an application today.
[2354.00s -> 2357.52s]  And I'm expecting you to pick something that's going to work for you.
[2357.52s -> 2358.72s]  Why would I change?
[2359.84s -> 2362.80s]  Why on earth would I change in that moment?
[2364.24s -> 2366.32s]  Todd Keely, is that how you say your last name?
[2366.64s -> 2367.60s]  Keely.
[2367.60s -> 2371.52s]  Keely, I'm just going to butcher everyone's last name.
[2371.52s -> 2375.28s]  Please just call me Francisco or something, whatever you want.
[2375.28s -> 2378.08s]  All right, my man, Todd, if you wouldn't mind,
[2378.08s -> 2380.08s]  tell me you're just here for information,
[2380.08s -> 2383.20s]  you just want to get some quotes, is that okay?
[2385.12s -> 2386.88s]  Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[2386.88s -> 2389.28s]  Okay, Todd, by the way, who are you direct to?
[2389.68s -> 2394.72s]  Jimmy Bandos and Keely.
[2396.40s -> 2399.04s]  There's 71 people on this call,
[2400.08s -> 2404.00s]  and all three people I've picked are in the Keely organization.
[2405.20s -> 2406.96s]  I'm kind of happy about that, actually.
[2406.96s -> 2408.72s]  I'm sensing favoritism.
[2409.68s -> 2411.20s]  I'm tired of you, we go folks,
[2411.20s -> 2413.68s]  and people who shouldn't be speaking and jumping in.
[2413.68s -> 2414.08s]  Thank you.
[2415.20s -> 2417.20s]  All right, Todd, here we go.
[2417.52s -> 2423.12s]  You're going to tell me all you want is quotes and education, okay?
[2424.00s -> 2427.76s]  So Todd, we sent you all the stuff, you did this, you did that,
[2427.76s -> 2430.96s]  like I did earlier, tell me what's your goal for this appointment?
[2432.24s -> 2434.16s]  I just want quotes and information.
[2435.84s -> 2439.12s]  Okay, I'll be understanding that, Todd.
[2440.96s -> 2443.28s]  You're here meeting with me on Zoom, right?
[2443.52s -> 2447.28s]  Okay, why do you just want quotes and information?
[2448.96s -> 2451.36s]  Because I just want to know how much it's going to cost me.
[2452.80s -> 2455.60s]  Absolutely, Todd, that's exactly why I'm here.
[2455.60s -> 2459.60s]  Let me tell you something, if you went in Google Life Insurance prices,
[2460.08s -> 2461.92s]  do you know how many different things you would get?
[2462.48s -> 2469.76s]  It is so challenging to find a program that is curated by an advocate for your family,
[2470.32s -> 2471.92s]  and that's what I'm going to do.
[2472.72s -> 2474.88s]  Is it important to you to get your family covered?
[2476.88s -> 2477.60s]  I mean, I'm sure.
[2478.88s -> 2480.08s]  Why is that important to you?
[2482.08s -> 2484.72s]  Because I care about them, I want to be able to care of them.
[2485.52s -> 2488.96s]  So does that mean you feel like if you didn't get coverage for them,
[2489.68s -> 2492.40s]  even today, that they wouldn't be protected?
[2494.32s -> 2495.68s]  Good possibility, yes.
[2496.80s -> 2497.92s]  Is it a possibility?
[2498.48s -> 2500.24s]  Do you have other plans, Todd?
[2501.92s -> 2503.28s]  No, not at this point, I don't.
[2504.16s -> 2506.32s]  Okay, so you probably need coverage for them.
[2507.84s -> 2508.08s]  Yeah.
[2508.72s -> 2511.04s]  Yeah, so we should probably get something in place today, shouldn't we?
[2512.40s -> 2513.28s]  Might be a good idea.
[2514.40s -> 2517.36s]  I mean, look, this is practice, right?
[2517.36s -> 2521.20s]  We're role-playing here, but my appointments are no different than this.
[2523.20s -> 2526.40s]  If they don't want to buy, they're going to tell you in the first five minutes,
[2526.40s -> 2529.76s]  and if I can't ask them, why aren't you buying today?
[2529.76s -> 2530.56s]  I am afraid.
[2532.08s -> 2534.80s]  And fear kills everything.
[2536.16s -> 2537.68s]  Fear kills everything.
[2537.68s -> 2539.20s]  All right, second video.
[2539.20s -> 2540.64s]  Oh, wow, we're at 1215.
[2541.28s -> 2545.52s]  I actually wanted to feel questions, but whoops, let me just get this right.
[2551.76s -> 2552.96s]  Yeah, okay.
[2553.68s -> 2563.04s]  You got to have no goals.
[2564.88s -> 2567.36s]  Now, by that I don't mean not to have goals.
[2568.24s -> 2570.24s]  We all know how important it is to set goals.
[2570.24s -> 2571.60s]  Goals setting has been drummed into us.
[2571.60s -> 2572.40s]  We get that, right?
[2572.96s -> 2575.60s]  I'm talking about the type of goals that we set.
[2575.60s -> 2579.44s]  Traditionally, most people set what we call yes goals.
[2579.44s -> 2581.68s]  Goals for the number of yeses you're going to hear.
[2581.68s -> 2584.08s]  How many people will say yes to your presentation?
[2584.08s -> 2586.08s]  How many people, or how much will they buy?
[2586.08s -> 2586.80s]  How many units?
[2586.80s -> 2587.84s]  How many dollars?
[2587.84s -> 2589.84s]  Those are all the results of people saying yes.
[2590.40s -> 2593.04s]  Matter of fact, most reports that you have in your work
[2593.04s -> 2595.04s]  are all yes reports, aren't they?
[2595.04s -> 2596.72s]  It's all the stuff that happened because of yes.
[2597.52s -> 2601.68s]  No goals are setting goals specifically for the number of times that you intend to hear
[2601.68s -> 2602.64s]  people saying no to you.
[2604.00s -> 2605.92s]  And you might think, well, cheese, it doesn't make sense.
[2605.92s -> 2607.12s]  Yes is what I want.
[2607.12s -> 2609.52s]  Yes, yes is the destination.
[2609.52s -> 2611.28s]  No is how you get there.
[2612.00s -> 2614.64s]  The problem with just having yes goals is this.
[2614.64s -> 2616.96s]  Take a copier sales person, classic example.
[2617.76s -> 2622.48s]  His goal is to sell two copiers for the week.
[2622.48s -> 2624.08s]  Gotta get two leases.
[2624.08s -> 2625.76s]  Goes out on Monday morning, makes the first call.
[2625.76s -> 2626.88s]  Person says yes.
[2626.88s -> 2627.68s]  Makes the second call.
[2627.68s -> 2628.80s]  Person says yes.
[2628.80s -> 2630.88s]  By noon on Monday, he has two sales.
[2631.68s -> 2633.20s]  What do you think is going to happen with the rest of that week?
[2634.56s -> 2635.36s]  He's going to golf.
[2635.36s -> 2636.32s]  He's going to lay by the pool.
[2636.32s -> 2637.36s]  He's going to do paperwork.
[2637.36s -> 2638.72s]  He's going to clean the garage.
[2638.72s -> 2639.76s]  He's going to do a lot of things.
[2639.76s -> 2642.00s]  He's going to cut out early on Friday for a three-day weekend.
[2642.00s -> 2642.96s]  He's going to do a lot of things.
[2642.96s -> 2644.32s]  I'll tell you what he isn't going to do.
[2644.32s -> 2646.08s]  He isn't going to keep hearing no.
[2646.08s -> 2647.68s]  And he isn't going to get past two copiers.
[2648.40s -> 2650.32s]  Because he had a yes goal of two.
[2650.32s -> 2653.28s]  That anytime we tend to hit our yes goal,
[2653.28s -> 2655.28s]  we tend to slow down or stop.
[2656.08s -> 2658.00s]  We start with the idea that the goal is to get to this number
[2658.00s -> 2658.48s]  when we get there.
[2658.48s -> 2660.08s]  He's like, great, goal accomplished.
[2660.80s -> 2663.52s]  But if you were setting no goals instead,
[2664.64s -> 2668.08s]  goals, the civic goals for the number of times people are going to say no to you.
[2668.08s -> 2670.80s]  Let's take that same copier salesperson.
[2670.80s -> 2672.32s]  Let's say he had a goal.
[2672.32s -> 2674.88s]  Your emotional reaction to yes and no
[2674.88s -> 2677.12s]  needs to be of equal intensity.
[2678.48s -> 2681.92s]  In other words, most of us have this tendency that when we hear no,
[2681.92s -> 2684.72s]  we get all upset and we get all deflated.
[2684.72s -> 2686.48s]  And it throws us for a loop.
[2686.48s -> 2690.80s]  And we go have a cord of hogging dust or climbing the corner and whatever it is.
[2691.52s -> 2692.56s]  And then we get a yes.
[2692.56s -> 2693.76s]  And what do we do?
[2693.76s -> 2696.08s]  We're happy and we celebrate and we high five.
[2696.56s -> 2697.76s]  We're all jazzed.
[2698.56s -> 2701.04s]  That emotional swing is a problem.
[2702.00s -> 2704.96s]  Because if you have a negative reaction to no
[2704.96s -> 2706.72s]  and a positive reaction to yes,
[2706.72s -> 2708.80s]  then you're going to be back with the old model, aren't you?
[2709.36s -> 2711.76s]  Trying to always go for yes and trying to avoid no.
[2712.56s -> 2714.88s]  If you can get a positive reaction to no
[2714.88s -> 2716.96s]  and not let it affect you so that every time you hear no,
[2716.96s -> 2718.80s]  you go, okay, another no, another no,
[2718.80s -> 2719.28s]  another no.
[2719.28s -> 2720.40s]  The yeses are coming.
[2720.40s -> 2722.00s]  All right, then eventually the yeses happen.
[2722.00s -> 2723.76s]  And instead of celebrating, you go, great,
[2723.76s -> 2726.96s]  got it, yes, got to keep going for no, going for no, going for no.
[2726.96s -> 2730.64s]  In other words, this emotional roller coaster.
[2730.64s -> 2731.60s]  And if you think of it in this turn,
[2731.60s -> 2734.64s]  so what's the shortest distance between two points?
[2735.52s -> 2736.40s]  Straight line.
[2736.40s -> 2738.56s]  What's the shortest distance between you and success?
[2739.28s -> 2740.32s]  Straight line.
[2740.32s -> 2742.40s]  It is not on an emotional roller coaster.
[2743.04s -> 2746.88s]  It is on an even healed emotional reaction.
[2747.44s -> 2749.60s]  You want to keep an even emotional reaction.
[2750.08s -> 2752.00s]  The goal here, ideally,
[2752.00s -> 2754.00s]  is to have all of your emotional reactions,
[2754.00s -> 2755.92s]  yes and no, to be in what we call this.
[2755.92s -> 2759.04s]  Here's some selling statistics that you have to be aware of,
[2759.04s -> 2760.32s]  that you must know.
[2761.68s -> 2765.20s]  44% of people give up after hearing one no.
[2767.84s -> 2770.40s]  22% more give up after the second no.
[2772.16s -> 2774.72s]  14% more give up after the third no.
[2776.40s -> 2778.80s]  12% more give up after the fourth no.
[2779.76s -> 2782.08s]  That means that 92% of all sales people give up
[2782.08s -> 2785.44s]  before getting a fifth no from customers
[2785.44s -> 2788.08s]  and yet the research project this came from
[2788.08s -> 2790.96s]  proved that 60% of all customers say no
[2790.96s -> 2793.20s]  four times before they finally say yes.
[2795.52s -> 2797.76s]  So if most sales people have quit before the fourth no,
[2797.76s -> 2800.24s]  it means 92% of people have gone home.
[2801.44s -> 2804.16s]  You want to get in the top 8% within your industry?
[2804.96s -> 2807.20s]  Learn to start getting five or more notes from your customers.
[2810.56s -> 2816.08s]  All right, what are some of our takeaways from there?
[2818.64s -> 2820.80s]  Whoops, sorry, my thing is still playing.
[2823.36s -> 2825.52s]  So some of the takeaways, first of all,
[2825.52s -> 2828.16s]  let's go back to the emotional piece of this, right?
[2828.16s -> 2829.68s]  How do I sell better on Zoom?
[2830.56s -> 2831.92s]  There's a couple of things.
[2831.92s -> 2833.44s]  Number one, make more appointments.
[2833.92s -> 2839.68s]  Right, we know that the no show rate,
[2839.68s -> 2841.76s]  I never use the word people use,
[2841.76s -> 2843.44s]  because I take this stuff seriously.
[2844.16s -> 2846.72s]  It's like a z and it rhymes with porch.
[2846.72s -> 2847.84s]  I think it's stupid.
[2848.48s -> 2850.80s]  When I hear that word, it reinforces,
[2850.80s -> 2853.84s]  who's the first person to hear the things I have to say?
[2855.28s -> 2855.84s]  It's me.
[2857.04s -> 2860.00s]  So if I talk about how Zoom is hard,
[2860.00s -> 2861.12s]  it's going to be hard.
[2862.08s -> 2865.76s]  If anybody on this training and this gathering tells me,
[2866.32s -> 2868.00s]  I can't do Zoom appointments.
[2868.00s -> 2870.72s]  I'm better in the home than I'm going to agree with you.
[2871.84s -> 2874.48s]  And you should just get off this training right now.
[2875.68s -> 2879.28s]  Right now, because if you believe it, they'll believe it.
[2880.08s -> 2881.44s]  And if you believe it, it's true.
[2884.00s -> 2885.84s]  And every time they say no,
[2885.84s -> 2888.88s]  if you think that's a statement on you as a person,
[2888.96s -> 2891.84s]  get off this training now, maybe leave symmetry.
[2893.20s -> 2895.36s]  Because this is a business of rejection.
[2896.64s -> 2900.08s]  And I will find the video that my friend Ryan did,
[2900.08s -> 2904.64s]  where he talked about this business specifically
[2905.60s -> 2907.36s]  will amplify your emotions.
[2909.04s -> 2910.80s]  If you're feeling, and he just said it,
[2910.80s -> 2912.32s]  if you're feeling excited,
[2912.32s -> 2914.64s]  you'll feel 100 times more excited.
[2914.64s -> 2917.36s]  How many of you have walked into a home or got on a Zoom,
[2917.36s -> 2920.56s]  thought they weren't going to buy, then wrote them for 300 bucks a month.
[2920.56s -> 2923.28s]  And was like, holy crap, I just made a few thousand dollars.
[2923.28s -> 2925.36s]  And then wanted to throw a party.
[2925.36s -> 2928.24s]  Like, I am the greatest thing since sliced bread.
[2930.16s -> 2931.84s]  By the way, that happened to me yesterday.
[2934.72s -> 2936.00s]  Lady wasn't buying.
[2936.00s -> 2937.84s]  She had more money than God.
[2937.84s -> 2942.56s]  And I was like, look, you can do this and have this much more.
[2943.12s -> 2944.72s]  She said, you're very smart.
[2945.52s -> 2946.48s]  Yes, I am.
[2947.36s -> 2948.16s]  You should do this.
[2948.80s -> 2949.76s]  Okay, I'll do it.
[2950.72s -> 2951.76s]  Bang, done.
[2952.56s -> 2955.28s]  I was 216, 2500 APB.
[2955.28s -> 2960.08s]  And I meet with her on Wednesday to talk about the 200 grand she has in savings for death
[2960.08s -> 2960.40s]  rely.
[2964.32s -> 2966.72s]  The cure is more appointments.
[2966.72s -> 2969.60s]  That's part of my story when I kept getting rejected.
[2969.60s -> 2975.12s]  Every time I got rejected, I would just say to myself, the cure is more appointments.
[2975.68s -> 2981.60s]  Tony Capastrano wrote $600,000 on his own pen said this in a training that I was at.
[2982.24s -> 2985.92s]  The difference between me and you is not that I'm smart.
[2985.92s -> 2986.80s]  I'm kind of an idiot.
[2987.60s -> 2992.08s]  The difference between me and you is I focus on the people who want insurance
[2992.08s -> 2994.00s]  and you focus on the people who don't.
[2996.80s -> 3000.16s]  Because we're all busy sitting around getting upset kicking ourselves
[3000.16s -> 3001.60s]  about the people who don't buy.
[3002.24s -> 3009.68s]  I'm not going to say the word, but in New Jersey, we would spell that F-U-G-G-E-M and move on.
[3011.52s -> 3012.24s]  Just move on.
[3014.72s -> 3018.80s]  We spend too much of our emotional time worrying about the people who say no.
[3019.36s -> 3021.28s]  And if you haven't read the book, go for no.
[3021.28s -> 3023.68s]  You can listen to the whole thing in like 90 minutes.
[3025.04s -> 3029.44s]  Right, it's all about how many times they're going to say no before they say yes.
[3030.40s -> 3034.16s]  And can I survive all of those times?
[3035.60s -> 3037.36s]  Now, how do I survive that, right?
[3038.24s -> 3043.60s]  It's that emotional piece that when they say I want quotes, I need to think about it,
[3043.60s -> 3044.64s]  that I don't run.
[3045.76s -> 3050.56s]  I don't run because I do the same process every time.
[3051.52s -> 3052.24s]  Why can't you?
[3053.28s -> 3056.24s]  Why can't you do the same process every time?
[3056.24s -> 3059.92s]  Why? Because the emotions tell you not to.
[3060.64s -> 3063.76s]  Okay, I'm terrible with streaks at the gym.
[3065.44s -> 3068.56s]  I'm terrible with streaks at eating healthy.
[3069.84s -> 3072.48s]  And I work really hard to get into that momentum.
[3073.04s -> 3076.00s]  But once I'm in that momentum, man, nothing can break it.
[3077.36s -> 3078.16s]  Nothing can break it.
[3079.36s -> 3085.20s]  So if you're doing your appointments the same way every time, nothing can stop it.
[3085.20s -> 3086.32s]  No one can break it.
[3088.40s -> 3093.36s]  I, one of my most famous favorite appointments was with this woman.
[3093.92s -> 3095.44s]  And she was like, well, just give me the price.
[3096.16s -> 3097.92s]  So man, I don't know the price.
[3097.92s -> 3099.28s]  How do I know the price?
[3099.28s -> 3101.52s]  I haven't, we haven't talked about your finances.
[3101.52s -> 3106.40s]  We haven't talked about your medicals, although I do have some basic information.
[3106.40s -> 3109.36s]  And on top of that, I don't know how much coverage you really need.
[3109.36s -> 3111.76s]  People think they need more than they really need.
[3111.76s -> 3115.60s]  And most times, they just need mortgage protection for a number of payments.
[3116.56s -> 3117.60s]  I always do this.
[3117.60s -> 3118.80s]  There's full payoff.
[3119.84s -> 3122.40s]  And then there's mortgage payments.
[3122.40s -> 3123.68s]  And they go, what does that mean?
[3123.68s -> 3127.92s]  I go, well, we customize a program for you that pays your mortgage for 12,
[3127.92s -> 3129.68s]  24, 36 months.
[3130.32s -> 3137.12s]  So that when something happens, and it's going to happen, I say that on every appointment,
[3137.12s -> 3144.24s]  I learn that from her name is right on the top of the middle company,
[3144.24s -> 3145.68s]  because her husband had a stroke.
[3146.32s -> 3147.84s]  It's going to happen.
[3149.12s -> 3151.20s]  When something happens, it's going to happen.
[3152.72s -> 3153.68s]  I will be there for you.
[3154.56s -> 3155.92s]  Did you hear Brian Delaney say that?
[3156.48s -> 3157.76s]  I say that on every appointment.
[3157.76s -> 3159.44s]  I will be there for you.
[3159.44s -> 3161.04s]  I'll get on a plane and I'll be there.
[3162.56s -> 3166.72s]  Don't all of us, when we get rolling, make enough money that when we have a death claim,
[3166.72s -> 3168.88s]  we can get on a damn plane and go see the client.
[3170.32s -> 3173.68s]  So yeah, I will get on a plane and I will be when something happens.
[3174.40s -> 3180.08s]  My sister-in-law, my other brother, right at two brothers, one brother passed in 2016,
[3180.08s -> 3182.80s]  started this business named the agency after him.
[3182.80s -> 3187.12s]  My other brother on March 26, I was sitting here in this office,
[3187.12s -> 3189.84s]  spent home 30 minutes to find his wife, dead.
[3192.48s -> 3195.84s]  Two times in my family, this has happened in the same house.
[3197.12s -> 3200.24s]  Do you think we know about death and grieving?
[3200.88s -> 3204.08s]  We wrote $25,000 and checks the next day.
[3205.92s -> 3206.72s]  The next day.
[3208.56s -> 3209.60s]  Bye Michelle, love you.
[3210.32s -> 3210.72s]  Anyways.
[3216.00s -> 3221.20s]  You have to believe and you have to work on self so that when they knock,
[3222.72s -> 3224.08s]  we just move past it.
[3224.08s -> 3225.92s]  Okay, one more thing I was asked to cover.
[3226.48s -> 3233.36s]  So we're going to email you a script that my business partner Ryan Federico wrote for the phone.
[3233.36s -> 3236.24s]  I shared it with the legal organization briefly and they're like,
[3236.24s -> 3237.68s]  oh my god, can I get that script?
[3237.68s -> 3239.52s]  People were like screen-shotting stuff.
[3240.40s -> 3246.88s]  And I'm not the super expert at this particularly, right?
[3246.88s -> 3250.80s]  I've always had challenges with myself of being consistent on the phone,
[3250.80s -> 3254.24s]  but I've gotten better, I've gotten better and every time I get on the phone,
[3254.24s -> 3255.28s]  I book the appointment.
[3255.28s -> 3257.76s]  So I don't know, you know, kind of what's my problem here.
[3258.40s -> 3260.64s]  It's personal development, right?
[3261.44s -> 3263.76s]  But I do want to go into it a little bit real quickly.
[3264.48s -> 3266.96s]  So, Connie.
[3268.00s -> 3268.24s]  Connie,
[3269.20s -> 3269.52s]  Furch?
[3271.12s -> 3271.92s]  Did I say it right?
[3272.56s -> 3273.12s]  You did.
[3273.76s -> 3274.96s]  Right on the nose.
[3274.96s -> 3276.72s]  Number one, free lunch for me.
[3276.72s -> 3278.32s]  All right, Connie,
[3279.36s -> 3281.12s]  can you be the client?
[3281.12s -> 3281.84s]  Can we roll play?
[3281.84s -> 3282.56s]  I'm going to call you.
[3283.28s -> 3283.52s]  Sure.
[3285.12s -> 3286.32s]  Hello, is this Connie?
[3286.32s -> 3287.20s]  This is Connie.
[3287.84s -> 3290.16s]  Connie, my name is Keith Fonseca.
[3290.16s -> 3294.16s]  I'm calling you from the mortgage protection department about your loan with Wells Fargo.
[3295.60s -> 3296.88s]  Oh, okay, yeah.
[3296.88s -> 3300.88s]  Yeah, Connie, back when you closed on the most recent loan for 250,000,
[3300.88s -> 3304.40s]  we'd sent you a letter regarding your mortgage protection options,
[3304.40s -> 3307.28s]  which would pay off your mortgage if you got sick or if you've died.
[3307.92s -> 3310.56s]  I wish that letter out mailed it back to us.
[3310.56s -> 3313.04s]  And I'm the field underwriter has been assigned to your case.
[3313.60s -> 3318.80s]  I just need to confirm some information so I can get those options you requested out to you.
[3318.80s -> 3323.68s]  And that says here that your date of birth is July 1st, 1984, is that correct?
[3324.40s -> 3325.28s]  Oh, I wish.
[3327.20s -> 3328.08s]  No, that's wrong.
[3328.08s -> 3329.04s]  Let's fix that.
[3329.04s -> 3330.00s]  Okay, perfect.
[3330.56s -> 3331.52s]  Have I got her hooked?
[3331.52s -> 3332.48s]  Did she engaged?
[3332.48s -> 3333.92s]  Are we on our way to an appointment?
[3333.92s -> 3335.28s]  Yes, yes, yes.
[3335.28s -> 3338.64s]  Okay, now if I'm dialing older leads, it's switched up a little.
[3339.12s -> 3340.00s]  And it goes,
[3341.84s -> 3343.84s]  call you by your mortgage protection options,
[3343.84s -> 3347.04s]  which would pay off your mortgage if you got sick or if you've died.
[3347.04s -> 3350.72s]  You filled that letter out and I'm calling to update our system.
[3350.72s -> 3352.88s]  I see here that we assigned you an agent,
[3352.88s -> 3354.96s]  but I don't have any updates after that.
[3354.96s -> 3356.40s]  Did you ever meet with that agent?
[3356.40s -> 3359.04s]  Or did we ever get those options you requested out to you?
[3359.84s -> 3362.08s]  Um, I thought I'd seen something, but I,
[3363.92s -> 3366.64s]  I didn't make a contact and I didn't get a contact back.
[3367.20s -> 3368.08s]  Got it, got it.
[3368.08s -> 3371.92s]  Yeah, I do a lot of things from time ago that I forget all the time.
[3371.92s -> 3372.80s]  No worries.
[3372.80s -> 3374.72s]  I just need to confirm some information.
[3374.72s -> 3378.24s]  So it says here that your date of birth is July 1st, 1948.
[3379.92s -> 3380.32s]  Yes.
[3381.36s -> 3382.56s]  Okay, perfect.
[3382.56s -> 3384.56s]  All right, we've got our hooked again.
[3384.56s -> 3388.56s]  Right now, uh, inside of the four-page thing that I sent you,
[3388.56s -> 3392.16s]  70 to 80% of the rejection you're going to get is what?
[3392.16s -> 3393.20s]  I'm not interested.
[3393.52s -> 3399.52s]  Okay, so if Connie was to say I'm not interested, I would say perfect.
[3400.00s -> 3401.52s]  That's exactly why I'm calling.
[3402.32s -> 3404.64s]  Just so you stop getting these calls from me,
[3404.64s -> 3406.00s]  uh, let me ask you this.
[3406.00s -> 3408.72s]  Are you no longer interested because you got coverage
[3408.72s -> 3412.40s]  or you no longer interested because someone showed you prices and it costs too much?
[3413.60s -> 3417.44s]  Uh, I actually seen prices and I think that it cost too much.
[3418.72s -> 3419.28s]  Perfect.
[3419.28s -> 3422.24s]  And now I roll into the cost too much rebuttal.
[3422.96s -> 3427.76s]  I gave her two options and she picked one and I rolled right into the other rebuttal.
[3427.76s -> 3430.00s]  It is that simple and I've emailed them out to you.
[3431.44s -> 3434.80s]  Uh, some of you remember a training that took place on Thursday.
[3435.44s -> 3440.48s]  It was Grand Nalajah and Grand had mentioned that he had booked 41 appointments
[3440.48s -> 3446.16s]  that week and that the show rate for all those appointments was, I don't know, like 80%.
[3446.80s -> 3448.48s]  It was Ryan's script that he used.
[3448.72s -> 3452.56s]  Okay, so now you have it.
[3453.68s -> 3456.16s]  Uh, can you tell that I know that opening?
[3458.00s -> 3459.68s]  Can you tell I say it with conviction?
[3461.84s -> 3464.56s]  I'm not letting her, you try to distract me Connie.
[3464.56s -> 3465.68s]  I'm not going to let it happen.
[3466.16s -> 3467.28s]  Stay right on point.
[3468.48s -> 3472.80s]  The second we open them to distract us is the second it goes off point.
[3472.80s -> 3475.20s]  Now there's a really great video from Rex Knight Jr.
[3475.20s -> 3476.00s]  I should post it.
[3476.00s -> 3477.28s]  It's on my phone.
[3477.36s -> 3480.88s]  I think it's on my Vimeo so I'll post it where he says, uh,
[3480.88s -> 3482.24s]  let's see if I can do this real quick.
[3482.24s -> 3483.68s]  I know we're almost out of time here.
[3486.00s -> 3488.16s]  Okay, so this is the phone call, right?
[3488.16s -> 3490.96s]  When you're booking an appointment, starts here.
[3492.88s -> 3495.36s]  And it ends with, okay, great.
[3495.36s -> 3499.60s]  I'll see you on Zoom tomorrow at 4 p.m., okay?
[3501.12s -> 3503.68s]  Now I start with the first 10 seconds,
[3504.56s -> 3510.40s]  which is I'm nailing the back when you close on the most recent loan for 200,000.
[3510.40s -> 3514.48s]  We send you a mortgage, we send you information about mortgage protection options,
[3514.48s -> 3516.88s]  which would pay off your mortgage if you got sick or if you die.
[3517.52s -> 3520.32s]  You fill that letter out and mail it back to us,
[3520.32s -> 3522.72s]  and I'm the field underwriters been assigned to your case.
[3523.20s -> 3526.56s]  Now right here, I want that your date of birth is, right?
[3526.56s -> 3527.52s]  That's the best script.
[3528.32s -> 3530.72s]  Now Connie goes, well, actually, you know what?
[3531.52s -> 3535.12s]  I wasn't sure what it was about, and I just thought I should get more information.
[3536.80s -> 3538.00s]  I have two choices.
[3539.36s -> 3540.96s]  One is the best script.
[3540.96s -> 3543.12s]  That's exactly why I'm calling.
[3543.12s -> 3545.28s]  So just to confirm your date of birth is,
[3546.08s -> 3549.04s]  or let me give you more information about mortgage protection.
[3549.04s -> 3551.68s]  It would pay off your house if you got sick or if you die.
[3551.68s -> 3553.36s]  And it's a really great program.
[3553.36s -> 3556.32s]  And you know what, my brother had it and it helped my family.
[3556.32s -> 3558.00s]  And I think you should have it too.
[3558.00s -> 3560.00s]  Well, I don't know if this is now Connie.
[3560.00s -> 3561.28s]  I don't know if I need it.
[3561.28s -> 3564.08s]  My husband did this and he was in the military.
[3564.08s -> 3565.76s]  Oh my goodness, I love the military.
[3565.76s -> 3567.20s]  Where did he serve in the military?
[3568.00s -> 3568.72s]  Where are we now?
[3571.28s -> 3575.12s]  How in the world can I expect to get from there back over here?
[3577.20s -> 3577.68s]  I can't.
[3578.56s -> 3582.00s]  Anytime I come off this line, I've got to get back on the line
[3582.00s -> 3583.68s]  of confirming your information.
[3584.64s -> 3586.48s]  Normally, we would meet with you in person,
[3586.48s -> 3588.88s]  but the insurance carriers have lightened up.
[3588.88s -> 3590.88s]  And so now we're doing a screen share.
[3590.88s -> 3592.56s]  Have you ever done a screen share before?
[3592.56s -> 3593.68s]  And I ask them right here.
[3593.68s -> 3595.84s]  I ask them the same question every time.
[3595.84s -> 3598.24s]  Do you have an iPhone or an Android?
[3599.92s -> 3603.84s]  And I would tell you that 95% say one of the two.
[3604.80s -> 3605.60s]  Because guess what?
[3606.24s -> 3608.48s]  Both of those, they can do a video chat on.
[3610.08s -> 3612.16s]  Do you have an iPhone or an Android?
[3612.96s -> 3615.04s]  And then as soon as they answer, go, okay, great.
[3615.04s -> 3615.84s]  Have you heard a Zoom?
[3616.64s -> 3619.04s]  Because we're going to do a Zoom meeting.
[3619.04s -> 3621.36s]  And if we're having challenges getting on the Zoom,
[3621.36s -> 3623.92s]  at least I can meet with you face-to-face on your cell phone.
[3625.36s -> 3626.16s]  Bang, bang.
[3627.60s -> 3629.20s]  All right, it's 12.32.
[3629.20s -> 3630.48s]  We're over time.
[3630.48s -> 3631.52s]  I could keep going.
[3632.40s -> 3633.76s]  Somebody give me direction.
[3633.76s -> 3634.96s]  Should I feel questions?
[3634.96s -> 3635.60s]  Should I?
[3635.60s -> 3636.40s]  What do you want?
[3636.40s -> 3637.76s]  Yeah, it's like we have, I mean,
[3637.76s -> 3640.32s]  I don't have any other zooms on this until noon.
[3640.32s -> 3641.68s]  So we have 30 minutes.
[3642.56s -> 3643.44s]  I do personally.
[3643.44s -> 3646.08s]  But yeah, anybody who wants to stay on and ask questions
[3646.08s -> 3648.40s]  as long as Mr. Fonseca is available,
[3649.12s -> 3650.16s]  I'm sure he will do so.
[3651.60s -> 3652.40s]  I agree.
[3652.40s -> 3654.72s]  I think this is too good to pass up.
[3654.72s -> 3659.20s]  And you're talking to a guy who closed 300,000 over Zoom.
[3660.08s -> 3663.92s]  So I got to believe that people have questions.
[3663.92s -> 3665.52s]  So is that where you want to go?
[3665.52s -> 3667.60s]  Keith, are there anything else you'd like to share?
[3667.60s -> 3669.12s]  No, let's go with questions.
[3669.92s -> 3673.20s]  Roll play, one of the more famous lines that I have
[3673.20s -> 3674.72s]  before I get the first question is
[3675.68s -> 3677.12s]  we did it on a national call.
[3678.08s -> 3680.32s]  I don't know where this came out of my mouth
[3680.32s -> 3681.36s]  and now people use it.
[3681.92s -> 3683.92s]  I just want quotes, right?
[3683.92s -> 3685.36s]  And I'll say the person, okay, great.
[3686.40s -> 3689.36s]  What are quotes in a drawer going to do for your family
[3689.36s -> 3690.64s]  when someone passes away?
[3691.60s -> 3692.00s]  Nothing.
[3692.80s -> 3694.40s]  But a policy will help you.
[3694.88s -> 3696.00s]  I will help you.
[3696.00s -> 3697.60s]  Let's get a policy not quotes.
[3699.60s -> 3700.56s]  I like that.
[3700.56s -> 3701.92s]  And Keith, if you don't mind too,
[3701.92s -> 3702.96s]  because I know people have heard it.
[3704.64s -> 3708.88s]  But there's a part in the last thing that I just said
[3708.88s -> 3709.92s]  this is recorded.
[3710.48s -> 3711.68s]  I loved your movement.
[3711.68s -> 3713.60s]  So I'm going to go back to this and find it.
[3716.24s -> 3717.28s]  You know what I'm talking about?
[3717.92s -> 3719.76s]  Like, I'm going to plug in a public square
[3719.76s -> 3721.20s]  if I don't do it the same again?
[3721.20s -> 3721.84s]  No, no, no.
[3721.84s -> 3723.84s]  I just want to get you know, you ask the three questions.
[3723.84s -> 3725.20s]  You have your goals and that.
[3725.20s -> 3726.08s]  And then you went in.
[3726.08s -> 3727.84s]  It was like in the middle of your script
[3728.00s -> 3731.04s]  where you were talking, just you think.
[3731.04s -> 3732.24s]  I can't remember the exact group.
[3732.24s -> 3733.36s]  It was so much.
[3733.36s -> 3733.60s]  Yeah.
[3734.16s -> 3735.44s]  What was the topic?
[3735.44s -> 3736.72s]  I'm trying to find it.
[3736.72s -> 3737.92s]  I've been to all these notes.
[3739.04s -> 3740.48s]  Melissa, if I can help you out,
[3740.48s -> 3742.00s]  it was the three questions.
[3742.00s -> 3743.36s]  Were you talking about the three questions
[3743.36s -> 3745.04s]  that he asks people?
[3745.04s -> 3745.84s]  He said, okay, guys,
[3745.84s -> 3748.16s]  this is a three questions you asked to get your sale.
[3748.16s -> 3749.84s]  And then you started listing them in the chat.
[3749.84s -> 3751.04s]  Is that what you were talking about?
[3751.04s -> 3752.80s]  No, because then it was the next part after that.
[3752.80s -> 3754.24s]  It was like when he was talking.
[3754.24s -> 3756.08s]  Yeah, so when I was talking to Todd.
[3756.80s -> 3759.20s]  Yeah, yeah, you just want quotes.
[3759.92s -> 3760.56s]  Curating.
[3760.56s -> 3761.36s]  Okay.
[3761.36s -> 3762.56s]  Yeah, the curating word.
[3762.56s -> 3764.64s]  That was when you said that like whatever that
[3764.64s -> 3767.68s]  verbage was, it was like a paragraph long,
[3767.68s -> 3768.88s]  but it was like perfect.
[3768.88s -> 3770.96s]  You could go on to Google.
[3770.96s -> 3772.40s]  I may not do it the same.
[3772.40s -> 3773.20s]  I know.
[3773.20s -> 3775.92s]  Now, you could go on to Google
[3775.92s -> 3777.92s]  and Google life insurance quotes
[3777.92s -> 3779.60s]  and you're going to get a whole bunch of stuff.
[3779.60s -> 3782.32s]  Actually, it's kind of confusing if you ask me.
[3783.12s -> 3784.80s]  Or we're here.
[3784.88s -> 3786.08s]  You're meeting with me.
[3786.08s -> 3789.68s]  How about I curate for you a plan
[3789.68s -> 3791.60s]  that's going to help your family
[3791.60s -> 3794.08s]  because we don't even know how much insurance you need.
[3794.80s -> 3797.28s]  And as an advocate for you,
[3797.28s -> 3799.76s]  it's my job to be able to figure out
[3799.76s -> 3802.16s]  and find out something that makes sense for you
[3802.16s -> 3803.04s]  and is affordable.
[3804.88s -> 3806.16s]  Probably before it was better.
[3809.20s -> 3810.48s]  No, that's I'm just yeah.
[3810.48s -> 3811.04s]  Nope.
[3811.04s -> 3813.12s]  And then so how about a curated plan for you
[3813.20s -> 3814.88s]  and your family as an advocate?
[3815.52s -> 3818.32s]  Yeah, I'm just trying to because like the best thief wins here.
[3818.32s -> 3820.40s]  And if you can just memorize like four lines,
[3820.40s -> 3822.00s]  I'm telling this, but I used to do all the time
[3822.00s -> 3824.00s]  I would just type things up and memorize them
[3824.00s -> 3824.80s]  and steal them.
[3824.80s -> 3826.80s]  And I love that verbage.
[3826.80s -> 3827.28s]  It's perfect.
[3827.28s -> 3830.40s]  Yeah, if when something happens
[3830.40s -> 3831.84s]  and it's going to happen
[3832.72s -> 3835.36s]  was LaShawn Toyer in our altitude conference,
[3835.36s -> 3837.04s]  she said that in a room and that thing
[3837.04s -> 3839.44s]  has made me thousands of dollars
[3839.44s -> 3840.48s]  just by repeating that.
[3841.44s -> 3843.76s]  Yeah, I actually had a client say that to me,
[3843.76s -> 3845.04s]  she's like, it's going to rain
[3845.04s -> 3846.32s]  and it's going to rain in all of us.
[3846.32s -> 3848.16s]  And when it does, I want to be ready.
[3848.16s -> 3849.52s]  So that's been my little goal is
[3849.52s -> 3850.40s]  it's going to rain.
[3850.40s -> 3851.36s]  I like it.
[3851.36s -> 3854.32s]  Body language helps a lot in meetings, right?
[3854.32s -> 3856.16s]  When I'm serious, I'm doing this.
[3856.16s -> 3858.00s]  When I'm animated, I'm doing this.
[3858.80s -> 3860.00s]  And there's a connection there.
[3861.68s -> 3864.56s]  You know, who's within their first 30 days
[3864.56s -> 3865.84s]  that has a question?
[3865.84s -> 3867.04s]  Just unmute and ask it.
[3871.12s -> 3871.92s]  First 30 days.
[3875.76s -> 3876.96s]  We're too afraid to speak.
[3877.92s -> 3878.72s]  The fear is there.
[3881.76s -> 3884.48s]  I know I've got a handful of people
[3884.48s -> 3887.52s]  who have written business in their first 30 days.
[3887.52s -> 3889.76s]  You guys don't be afraid to speak up.
[3889.76s -> 3892.00s]  This is an excellent opportunity for you
[3892.00s -> 3895.20s]  to have some questions answered.
[3896.48s -> 3898.64s]  I thought that I'm just going to pick somebody.
[3898.72s -> 3900.56s]  It keeps, I'm not in my first 30 days,
[3900.56s -> 3903.20s]  but I still would like your opinion on
[3903.20s -> 3906.00s]  if you get one person there
[3906.00s -> 3907.52s]  and the other one's not there.
[3907.52s -> 3908.48s]  They're not going to show.
[3908.48s -> 3911.12s]  Do you still even stop started?
[3911.12s -> 3912.08s]  Or do you just say, you know what?
[3912.08s -> 3913.12s]  I'm not going to do it at all.
[3913.12s -> 3915.52s]  Or do you try and get in place
[3915.52s -> 3917.68s]  like the wife or the husband and say,
[3917.68s -> 3920.32s]  I can call back and talk to your wife
[3920.32s -> 3921.60s]  and try and get her set up.
[3921.60s -> 3923.04s]  Or I'll set you up now.
[3923.04s -> 3925.04s]  Or do you just say, I'm not going to do it right now
[3925.04s -> 3926.32s]  because there's only one person.
[3926.32s -> 3927.92s]  I'm curious how you want to handle that.
[3927.92s -> 3930.72s]  I haven't had it in a while, but I, you know, your thoughts.
[3930.72s -> 3931.76s]  Love that question.
[3931.76s -> 3933.52s]  Thank you, Kevin, for speaking up.
[3935.12s -> 3938.08s]  It was actually the story I started to tell earlier
[3938.08s -> 3940.16s]  and stopped because the lady kept saying,
[3940.16s -> 3940.88s]  what's the quote?
[3940.88s -> 3941.52s]  What's the quote?
[3941.52s -> 3942.96s]  I kept going through my process
[3942.96s -> 3944.48s]  and then I got into the financial part of it.
[3944.48s -> 3948.40s]  She's like, I'm not going to give you this information.
[3948.40s -> 3949.76s]  I just want to damn quote.
[3949.76s -> 3951.28s]  I said, ma'am, I'm probably not for you
[3951.28s -> 3952.08s]  and I hung up on it.
[3954.56s -> 3957.52s]  So I can answer that fairly simply, right?
[3958.88s -> 3961.52s]  By using the fear strategy, the no fear.
[3962.32s -> 3963.92s]  So Kevin, let me ask you a question.
[3963.92s -> 3966.24s]  I realize we're looking at mortgage protection
[3966.24s -> 3968.64s]  and you know, your wife's not here today.
[3968.64s -> 3970.16s]  Tell me, is this important to her?
[3971.36s -> 3972.88s]  Yeah, I think so.
[3972.88s -> 3973.84s]  Okay, great.
[3973.84s -> 3976.48s]  Is it important to her that you get some protection
[3976.48s -> 3977.68s]  in place so she's covered?
[3978.40s -> 3979.20s]  Definitely.
[3979.20s -> 3982.00s]  So do you think like she's going to have an opinion
[3982.00s -> 3984.16s]  about what we do, how much you cost,
[3984.16s -> 3985.68s]  what you should do or not?
[3985.68s -> 3987.28s]  Yeah, I mean, I don't do anything
[3987.28s -> 3988.40s]  without touching base with her.
[3989.04s -> 3989.92s]  Wonderful.
[3989.92s -> 3992.16s]  So here's what I think we should do, right?
[3992.16s -> 3993.76s]  Let me gather some information
[3993.76s -> 3995.52s]  and then let's schedule another time
[3995.52s -> 3998.24s]  when you and your wife can definitely be here
[3998.24s -> 4001.84s]  because as we spoke on the phone, when we scheduled this,
[4001.84s -> 4004.24s]  I asked you, now remember, that's in the chat box.
[4004.24s -> 4007.28s]  People I put a video, Miranda Martin Ben Miller
[4007.28s -> 4008.64s]  locking down grade appointments
[4008.64s -> 4010.56s]  and in there they use the language,
[4010.56s -> 4014.32s]  is this a good time for you and your spouse?
[4014.32s -> 4015.52s]  Not is it?
[4015.52s -> 4018.40s]  Will you and your spouse definitely be there, right?
[4018.40s -> 4020.08s]  So Kevin, when we talked on the phone,
[4020.08s -> 4021.60s]  you said you and your spouse would be here
[4021.60s -> 4025.28s]  and I know lots of folks, they can't decide,
[4025.28s -> 4027.04s]  I mean, happy wife, happy life, right?
[4028.08s -> 4030.32s]  So it'd be tough to make a decision here
[4030.32s -> 4031.52s]  right now without your wife.
[4031.52s -> 4033.44s]  So why don't I just gather some info
[4033.44s -> 4035.92s]  and let's make another appointment to get together
[4035.92s -> 4037.60s]  when your wife is definitely available?
[4037.60s -> 4039.28s]  How about can you just give me the information
[4039.28s -> 4040.24s]  and I'll touch base with her
[4040.24s -> 4041.68s]  and then we can get back with you?
[4041.68s -> 4043.04s]  You could certainly do that.
[4043.20s -> 4046.32s]  The challenge is there is I'm sure she has questions
[4046.32s -> 4049.28s]  and those questions typically are going to be directed to me,
[4049.28s -> 4051.68s]  right? I want to be able to answer them as the expert
[4051.68s -> 4053.12s]  to show up for your family.
[4053.12s -> 4054.96s]  This is a plan for your family
[4054.96s -> 4057.44s]  for the next 15, 20, 30 years.
[4057.44s -> 4059.20s]  We don't want to miss anything, right?
[4059.20s -> 4062.72s]  So let's get together in another time.
[4062.72s -> 4065.44s]  Let me gather a few bits of information.
[4065.44s -> 4070.44s]  I see here I have an opening tomorrow at 5 and 7.
[4070.44s -> 4072.24s]  Which one works better for you anyway?
[4073.12s -> 4074.32s]  I think maybe seven.
[4075.92s -> 4076.80s]  Got it.
[4076.80s -> 4079.52s]  Let me ask you another question, Kevin.
[4079.52s -> 4081.36s]  Is this really important to you
[4081.36s -> 4082.64s]  to get this figured out?
[4083.52s -> 4083.84s]  Yeah.
[4084.64s -> 4086.56s]  Do you think if you guys didn't have cable
[4086.56s -> 4089.20s]  and the cable guy said tomorrow from 9 to noon
[4089.20s -> 4092.40s]  or 1 to 4, you would be home for the cable guy?
[4092.40s -> 4093.60s]  Would you miss the cable guy?
[4094.32s -> 4095.44s]  Definitely not.
[4095.44s -> 4097.68s]  Yeah, most people would not miss the cable guy.
[4097.68s -> 4099.44s]  Everybody wants to see their sports.
[4099.44s -> 4101.84s]  But when we're talking about protecting your family
[4101.92s -> 4103.84s]  for the next 25, 30 years,
[4104.96s -> 4106.00s]  people are aloof.
[4106.00s -> 4106.64s]  Right, Kevin?
[4107.44s -> 4109.60s]  Give me the time tomorrow
[4109.60s -> 4112.08s]  that you and your wife are definitely going to be here
[4112.08s -> 4114.24s]  so I can serve and protect your family.
[4114.24s -> 4116.32s]  If we're not going to do that, that's okay.
[4116.32s -> 4118.64s]  But at least help me help you.
[4118.64s -> 4120.16s]  Are we going to meet at 5?
[4120.16s -> 4121.36s]  Are we going to meet at 7?
[4121.36s -> 4123.20s]  And you and she definitely are going to be there.
[4123.92s -> 4124.48s]  Great.
[4124.48s -> 4127.44s]  So what information would you grab back from them?
[4127.44s -> 4131.20s]  I mean, because you're medicals, probably your medicals.
[4131.20s -> 4135.04s]  And I dive into as much of the financial analysis as I could.
[4135.68s -> 4137.44s]  Right, people ask me all the time,
[4137.44s -> 4140.56s]  how do I flip mortgage protection in the debt-free life?
[4140.56s -> 4144.64s]  Well, my financial analysis includes all the debt-free life questions.
[4144.64s -> 4145.68s]  I just build it in.
[4146.48s -> 4149.84s]  So you get the financial fire drill out of the way
[4149.84s -> 4151.60s]  and that way you can kind of delve right into it
[4151.60s -> 4152.24s]  if you get the best.
[4152.24s -> 4153.68s]  As much as possible.
[4153.68s -> 4155.04s]  Okay, no, that's a good plan.
[4155.04s -> 4157.60s]  Because that's where I was kind of losing where I should go with it
[4157.60s -> 4159.44s]  because I don't want to get a crisis.
[4159.44s -> 4161.20s]  You're 80% the mac and call you back.
[4161.76s -> 4163.36s]  I love your demeanor, Kevin.
[4163.36s -> 4165.04s]  Now speaking directly to you,
[4165.04s -> 4169.44s]  I love that you have taken this thing by the cojones.
[4169.44s -> 4171.60s]  And I know in an appointment,
[4171.60s -> 4174.16s]  if somebody asked me would Kevin Ferrell
[4174.16s -> 4178.00s]  in an appointment be able to say kind of the things I just did
[4178.00s -> 4179.60s]  with the kind of verbato of like,
[4179.60s -> 4181.20s]  look, if the cable guy was coming,
[4181.92s -> 4183.44s]  would you be there for the cable guy?
[4183.44s -> 4186.00s]  Like most of us are afraid to touch that button
[4186.00s -> 4188.16s]  because that's like a little personal.
[4188.16s -> 4191.76s]  That's like a, hey, I'm challenging you to admit
[4191.76s -> 4193.36s]  that you like cable more than your family.
[4194.00s -> 4195.04s]  But guess what?
[4195.04s -> 4197.52s]  If I don't do that, are they buying anyways?
[4200.16s -> 4202.88s]  Will they remember my name five minutes from now?
[4202.88s -> 4203.12s]  No.
[4203.92s -> 4205.04s]  Or vice versa.
[4206.88s -> 4210.88s]  So it's just like, do I have the security
[4211.92s -> 4213.60s]  to ask those questions?
[4213.60s -> 4216.56s]  Now let's look at top producers like Jeremy Whitaker.
[4217.36s -> 4218.08s]  Right?
[4218.08s -> 4220.00s]  Like Rossi and Tugberg.
[4221.04s -> 4223.12s]  Like Nick and Patty Compertori.
[4223.12s -> 4224.88s]  You've seen these guys on national calls.
[4225.52s -> 4225.84s]  Right?
[4225.84s -> 4226.48s]  Let's go.
[4226.48s -> 4229.20s]  Elijah's going to be on the call on Wednesday.
[4229.20s -> 4229.44s]  Right?
[4229.44s -> 4234.24s]  Let me go down the names of people that have written 20, 30, 40, 50.
[4234.24s -> 4234.48s]  Right?
[4234.48s -> 4235.76s]  And may I wrote 60?
[4235.76s -> 4237.04s]  And June, I wrote 60.
[4237.04s -> 4238.80s]  And July, I wrote 72.
[4239.60s -> 4243.52s]  Do you think any of those people I just name would be afraid to say?
[4243.52s -> 4245.92s]  Well, do you think if the cable guy was coming between
[4245.92s -> 4247.84s]  nine and one, you would definitely be there?
[4247.84s -> 4248.56s]  No.
[4248.56s -> 4250.16s]  Watch the national call.
[4250.16s -> 4250.48s]  Right?
[4250.48s -> 4253.60s]  Watch when Darren Stubbs is speaking like last Wednesday.
[4253.60s -> 4258.80s]  If it looks like he has an ounce of fear of asking that question
[4258.80s -> 4261.84s]  and then ask yourself, who's holding me back?
[4261.84s -> 4262.80s]  Is it the lead?
[4262.80s -> 4263.92s]  Is it the client?
[4263.92s -> 4265.20s]  Is it my mentor?
[4265.20s -> 4266.56s]  Is it symmetry?
[4266.56s -> 4268.32s]  No, no, no, no.
[4269.68s -> 4270.08s]  It's me.
[4270.72s -> 4273.36s]  I got to tell you, I used one of your lines with Jim Ruspin
[4273.36s -> 4274.32s]  on the line the other day.
[4274.32s -> 4276.80s]  We had a client on and they said,
[4276.80s -> 4279.20s]  you know, I got to talk to my financial advisor.
[4279.20s -> 4281.20s]  And I fled out and said, why the heck would you do that?
[4281.84s -> 4284.48s]  I go, I've just talked to you for the last 30 minutes.
[4284.48s -> 4286.96s]  I go, your financial advisor has no clue about life insurance.
[4287.60s -> 4290.48s]  And Jim was on the line and I felt more confident with Jim on the line
[4290.48s -> 4292.16s]  and I remember what you told me.
[4292.16s -> 4294.96s]  And then I just said, I've just done all of your shopping.
[4294.96s -> 4296.48s]  You're not going to find a better price.
[4296.48s -> 4299.68s]  And my regional director on who said you're not going to find a better price.
[4299.68s -> 4301.44s]  So why do you need to go to a financial advisor
[4301.44s -> 4302.88s]  that has done absolutely nothing for you?
[4303.68s -> 4305.12s]  So why don't we just get this done now?
[4306.00s -> 4308.88s]  It's husband looked at the way he goes, yeah, he's right, let's go.
[4309.44s -> 4312.32s]  So I kind of, Jim started lapping his text and he goes,
[4312.32s -> 4313.12s]  he goes, perfect.
[4313.12s -> 4317.04s]  You know, so I'm like going, it's, it is, you say, you're like, oh,
[4317.04s -> 4317.76s]  shit, I just said it.
[4317.76s -> 4319.12s]  But then they're like, yeah, you're right.
[4319.12s -> 4322.64s]  You know, and it's, it is, since you've been telling me to do that,
[4322.64s -> 4326.08s]  I've gotten four or five 4,000 APV from two people
[4326.08s -> 4327.04s]  that said they didn't want to do it.
[4327.68s -> 4328.80s]  And I said, why?
[4328.80s -> 4331.36s]  And it was select quote type of a line.
[4331.36s -> 4332.40s]  I'm not select quote.
[4332.56s -> 4333.60s]  I just researched it.
[4333.60s -> 4336.16s]  And everything you've been saying is 100% true.
[4336.16s -> 4339.44s]  And people just kind of realize that the first time you say to someone,
[4339.44s -> 4340.96s]  you're like, oh, my God, they're going to hang up on me.
[4340.96s -> 4342.56s]  Are they going to say, you know, screw you?
[4342.56s -> 4343.28s]  But they don't.
[4343.28s -> 4343.92s]  They, you're right.
[4343.92s -> 4346.56s]  They go, oh, shit, this guy just told me to shut up and do it.
[4346.56s -> 4348.00s]  And you didn't, you know?
[4348.00s -> 4349.60s]  And it's because he's there to help me.
[4350.80s -> 4353.44s]  I mean, what are people buying, right?
[4353.44s -> 4355.60s]  First of all, Brian said it in that video.
[4355.60s -> 4357.76s]  I showed you what you can find on Facebook
[4357.76s -> 4359.60s]  under the Delaney agency.
[4359.60s -> 4360.80s]  They got a bunch of videos.
[4361.44s -> 4363.20s]  But what did Brian, Brian said it?
[4363.20s -> 4366.64s]  He said, I have to believe that I'm the best person for them.
[4366.64s -> 4368.40s]  Going to create the best policy.
[4368.40s -> 4370.40s]  Going to create the best coverage.
[4370.40s -> 4373.60s]  And that nobody else is going to do that better than me because I care about that.
[4374.40s -> 4376.56s]  If I don't believe that, I should not show up.
[4377.84s -> 4380.64s]  So I, you know, I learned this early on, right?
[4380.64s -> 4383.36s]  After I kept going to sell, to sell, to sell.
[4383.36s -> 4384.64s]  And I wasn't selling.
[4384.64s -> 4387.04s]  I realized they're not buying insurance.
[4388.32s -> 4389.52s]  They're buying me.
[4391.12s -> 4392.56s]  They're buying my plan.
[4393.20s -> 4394.72s]  They're buying my leadership.
[4394.72s -> 4399.36s]  But if I'm not confident enough to present me my plan and my leadership,
[4399.36s -> 4401.44s]  why the hell would they be confident in me?
[4403.28s -> 4405.76s]  One thing you said is stop thinking about APV.
[4406.40s -> 4408.16s]  And that's, that's the same thing.
[4408.16s -> 4409.44s]  Think about how you're helping them.
[4409.44s -> 4412.32s]  If you're thinking about your dollar amount, you just lost.
[4412.32s -> 4413.84s]  You're, you're never going to win it.
[4413.84s -> 4415.84s]  And that's, that's the mindset you told me about.
[4415.84s -> 4419.60s]  And that's, that's changed because when you go in like, here's a plan.
[4419.60s -> 4422.96s]  If you go, oh, I missed 4,000 APV, you're not going to sell.
[4424.40s -> 4426.16s]  Well, that's reversing, right?
[4426.16s -> 4432.56s]  I did, I famously did a video last year where I went into a home, 73 and 70.
[4433.20s -> 4435.76s]  And the 70 year old woman was totally healthy.
[4435.76s -> 4437.68s]  And the 73 year old man had cancer.
[4438.64s -> 4440.24s]  Had had cancer.
[4440.24s -> 4442.64s]  So I was like, I'm not going to sell them anything today.
[4442.64s -> 4445.20s]  And I rolled up because I wasn't lying doing well.
[4445.20s -> 4449.04s]  And I was like, if anybody knows me, I'm an emotional
[4449.04s -> 4450.24s]  feeler of an empath.
[4450.24s -> 4452.24s]  I was like, falling my eyes out outside.
[4452.24s -> 4454.40s]  And I'm like, all right, am I getting out of this car,
[4454.40s -> 4455.44s]  worrying about myself?
[4455.44s -> 4456.96s]  I'm getting out of this car.
[4456.96s -> 4459.20s]  Now I try to take that to zoom every time.
[4459.20s -> 4462.00s]  And I'll never be in a car for an appointment again.
[4462.00s -> 4462.80s]  Plain and simple.
[4462.80s -> 4464.40s]  I can see more people.
[4464.40s -> 4466.32s]  I'm comfortable here in my office.
[4466.32s -> 4468.00s]  I know I've been working on my background.
[4468.00s -> 4469.12s]  It's super cool.
[4469.12s -> 4471.12s]  It's very ultra colorful and all that.
[4471.84s -> 4475.52s]  But I walked in and I just said, leave myself in the car.
[4475.52s -> 4477.36s]  By the way, these glasses are fake.
[4477.44s -> 4479.76s]  Every pair of glasses I've ever worn are fake.
[4479.76s -> 4481.04s]  I don't need glasses.
[4481.04s -> 4483.60s]  But I can put the, well, I mean, these are blue light blocking.
[4483.60s -> 4486.16s]  But when I put the glasses on, I can be whoever I want.
[4487.20s -> 4489.92s]  I don't have to be the Keith that's feeling badly
[4489.92s -> 4492.32s]  about the M&MZ 8th this morning.
[4492.32s -> 4494.40s]  By the way, I did not eat M&M's this morning.
[4494.40s -> 4495.60s]  I just want to be clear about that.
[4495.60s -> 4497.84s]  I have it by me, right?
[4497.84s -> 4500.64s]  But I can, I could be whoever I want.
[4500.64s -> 4502.00s]  So I walked in.
[4502.00s -> 4503.44s]  I was just there for them.
[4503.44s -> 4505.04s]  And at the end, I said, Dan,
[4505.12s -> 4508.56s]  doesn't it make sense to provide $40,000 for your wife?
[4508.56s -> 4509.76s]  I forget her name.
[4509.76s -> 4511.92s]  I know it's $340 a month.
[4511.92s -> 4512.88s]  But you can afford it.
[4512.88s -> 4513.60s]  We should do this.
[4513.60s -> 4514.72s]  And he's like, you know what, you're right.
[4514.72s -> 4515.36s]  Let's do it.
[4516.64s -> 4519.68s]  And I walked out of there and I was like, holy schnikes.
[4519.68s -> 4520.64s]  Did that just happen?
[4522.80s -> 4525.36s]  And I realized he bought me.
[4526.80s -> 4528.88s]  I could have told him it was 500 bucks a month.
[4528.88s -> 4530.96s]  But whatever it was, he bought me.
[4530.96s -> 4532.08s]  Now, I'm not being ridiculous.
[4532.08s -> 4533.36s]  But he bought me.
[4533.44s -> 4534.72s]  He bought my confidence.
[4535.60s -> 4537.12s]  Three musketeers, thanks Mark.
[4540.96s -> 4544.72s]  He absolutely bought the confidence.
[4544.72s -> 4546.40s]  So how do I build confidence?
[4547.12s -> 4550.48s]  I went to, I think I posted it on SoundCloud.
[4550.48s -> 4551.36s]  I put it in there.
[4551.92s -> 4553.76s]  Carlton Lear did a thing.
[4553.76s -> 4556.08s]  It's the last four minutes of that SoundCloud
[4556.08s -> 4557.36s]  because he was on a different call.
[4557.36s -> 4559.44s]  But the last four minutes he talks about,
[4559.44s -> 4561.44s]  I'm going to keep it right here, right next to me.
[4562.40s -> 4564.48s]  Black of confidence and the lack of belief
[4565.84s -> 4567.44s]  creates insecurity.
[4567.44s -> 4570.40s]  Commitment to self creates confidence and discipline.
[4572.64s -> 4574.56s]  So the commitment to myself,
[4574.56s -> 4576.96s]  that doing the things I say I'm going to do
[4576.96s -> 4577.92s]  creates confidence.
[4578.72s -> 4582.24s]  And doing the things I should be doing
[4582.24s -> 4586.08s]  without anyone telling me to do them creates belief.
[4586.08s -> 4589.12s]  So this is what I'm saying about when it comes to life,
[4589.12s -> 4591.76s]  there's all these reasons are not successful.
[4591.76s -> 4593.76s]  And the only reason which is a hard,
[4593.76s -> 4596.08s]  a hard thing to hear is myself.
[4596.08s -> 4597.84s]  Now I am a child.
[4597.84s -> 4600.08s]  I am a person of anxiety,
[4600.08s -> 4601.52s]  depression, and insecurity.
[4601.52s -> 4604.08s]  So when someone tells me it's on you,
[4604.08s -> 4605.12s]  I've got two choices.
[4605.84s -> 4606.96s]  It's what, uh,
[4606.96s -> 4609.44s]  Brunei Brown calls the vulnerability choice.
[4610.24s -> 4614.56s]  I can choose to be what's called a Viking or a Victor, right?
[4614.56s -> 4616.00s]  So Vikings run through the world,
[4616.00s -> 4618.16s]  swinging bats, hidden people like
[4618.16s -> 4619.92s]  and they don't even think about their feelings.
[4619.92s -> 4621.44s]  Forget it. I'm just going to run you over.
[4622.80s -> 4624.32s]  Victims are like, well,
[4625.04s -> 4628.00s]  I was talking to another agent the other day and she was like,
[4628.00s -> 4629.36s]  well, he doesn't support me.
[4630.72s -> 4631.68s]  I was like, what's this at mean?
[4632.40s -> 4634.08s]  Well, he doesn't meet me where I'm at.
[4634.88s -> 4636.88s]  And my question is, why do you need him to?
[4636.88s -> 4640.16s]  Well, he's my outline and he's this and he's that.
[4640.16s -> 4642.16s]  And I'm like, so does he own your business?
[4642.88s -> 4643.12s]  No.
[4644.08s -> 4645.92s]  Does he dictate your activity?
[4645.92s -> 4648.88s]  No. Does he control your leads?
[4648.88s -> 4649.92s]  Well, he could,
[4649.92s -> 4651.28s]  but could you do it without him?
[4651.28s -> 4651.68s]  Yes.
[4652.96s -> 4654.72s]  So what are we talking about here?
[4655.44s -> 4658.56s]  Why are you so hot after someone serving you
[4658.56s -> 4660.24s]  that you clearly don't like?
[4660.24s -> 4661.76s]  Is never going to change?
[4661.76s -> 4663.60s]  Does not have your best interest in heart?
[4664.72s -> 4665.84s]  By the way, that exists.
[4665.84s -> 4666.80s]  It's symmetry people.
[4668.24s -> 4668.80s]  Right?
[4668.80s -> 4671.04s]  And you know, Karen Reed is on this call.
[4671.04s -> 4673.84s]  I didn't see if like Jim and Alex were on this call.
[4673.84s -> 4675.12s]  I know Ki is on this call.
[4675.12s -> 4676.72s]  Melissa's on this call.
[4676.72s -> 4680.48s]  Like you have amazing managers on this call.
[4681.84s -> 4683.92s]  You are very, very lucky.
[4685.20s -> 4688.16s]  There are some people that come into symmetry.
[4688.72s -> 4690.88s]  Their outline tells them something.
[4690.88s -> 4691.92s]  They're excited.
[4691.92s -> 4693.92s]  And then they learn who their outline really is.
[4694.64s -> 4697.36s]  And they don't realize it doesn't matter.
[4698.16s -> 4699.20s]  It does not matter.
[4700.00s -> 4702.48s]  My outline never call farasters for me.
[4702.48s -> 4704.80s]  I call farasters for about a hundred hours.
[4705.12s -> 4706.32s]  To learn deaf-free life.
[4707.52s -> 4710.16s]  My outline never sold a policy for me.
[4711.36s -> 4713.76s]  My outline never called underwriting for me.
[4714.96s -> 4717.20s]  All he did was tell me where to go.
[4718.08s -> 4719.28s]  I had to do it.
[4719.28s -> 4720.48s]  Not don't even have to ask him.
[4722.08s -> 4724.24s]  So it doesn't matter.
[4724.24s -> 4726.88s]  And you can see now in Kevin Farrell,
[4726.88s -> 4729.92s]  which by the way, if you watch that Closer's Corner thing,
[4729.92s -> 4732.00s]  famously you're going to see me screaming at Kevin.
[4735.12s -> 4737.84s]  You see the confidence, right Kevin?
[4737.84s -> 4740.96s]  You're going to be the number one writer at Symmetry Financial Group next year.
[4740.96s -> 4741.60s]  I have no doubt.
[4743.36s -> 4746.00s]  I'll make you a true believer.
[4747.20s -> 4748.88s]  I already have a question.
[4748.88s -> 4749.12s]  Yeah.
[4750.16s -> 4752.40s]  So for you to write that type of business,
[4752.40s -> 4756.00s]  just so that people understand that you really have to manage your schedule.
[4756.00s -> 4762.08s]  So how are you, you know, if you're writing 10k a week and you might be doing more or less,
[4762.08s -> 4763.52s]  what does that look like?
[4763.52s -> 4764.80s]  How do you run your schedule?
[4764.80s -> 4766.32s]  How many appointments are you booking?
[4767.20s -> 4768.24s]  How are you booking?
[4768.24s -> 4770.08s]  Are you booking same day next day?
[4770.08s -> 4772.40s]  Are you booking 48 hours away?
[4772.40s -> 4774.56s]  Like, how are you actually managing it?
[4774.56s -> 4777.04s]  Because I know a lot of new people on this call,
[4778.00s -> 4780.24s]  you know, they'll tell me that,
[4780.96s -> 4782.64s]  they couldn't see me till next week.
[4782.64s -> 4783.60s]  It's a Zoom appointment.
[4783.60s -> 4785.68s]  They couldn't see me, you know, till next Friday.
[4786.56s -> 4790.56s]  And nine times out of 10, they're going to no show, right?
[4790.64s -> 4794.56s]  So how do you get people to book when you want them to book?
[4794.56s -> 4796.72s]  How does that all, how do you, how do you do it?
[4796.72s -> 4798.40s]  And how many appointments are you running to,
[4798.40s -> 4800.40s]  to do that, those kind of numbers?
[4800.40s -> 4802.16s]  First of all, take a look at my calendar.
[4804.80s -> 4806.64s]  I have my meals program.
[4810.96s -> 4815.20s]  So you book back to back in our, our, a part?
[4815.20s -> 4818.00s]  I've booked an hour hour long things.
[4818.88s -> 4820.08s]  Mine never go an hour.
[4820.08s -> 4822.40s]  They go 90 minutes, sometimes two hours.
[4822.40s -> 4823.52s]  I become family.
[4825.12s -> 4827.44s]  What happens when you run into another one?
[4827.44s -> 4829.92s]  Do you just text the person and tell him or?
[4829.92s -> 4831.20s]  Yeah, how does that work?
[4831.20s -> 4833.28s]  Do the best to let them know we're running behind.
[4834.16s -> 4837.84s]  Ninja Diler allows you to pre-program emails and texts.
[4838.40s -> 4841.20s]  So to let people know if you're in the waiting room, this and that,
[4842.24s -> 4844.72s]  you know, some, a lot of, you know, people will no show.
[4844.72s -> 4845.92s]  So then I can jump over.
[4846.64s -> 4850.24s]  Look, I'm the symmetry system for Zoom, right?
[4850.24s -> 4853.68s]  There've been a number of trainings on Zoom and how to get better.
[4853.68s -> 4856.00s]  And it's all on sfglife.com.
[4856.00s -> 4859.44s]  But it's book in 15 to 20 appointments a week, right?
[4859.44s -> 4864.24s]  Closer to 20 because the show rate for Zoom is a little bit,
[4864.24s -> 4868.24s]  see, Kevin, the show rate for Zoom is a little bit different than the home, right?
[4868.24s -> 4871.76s]  If I knock on the, on their door and they forgot I was coming,
[4871.76s -> 4873.84s]  I can still force my way to the table.
[4873.92s -> 4876.80s]  But to get them on to Zoom sometimes is challenging.
[4876.80s -> 4881.04s]  So 20 appointments a week is a good rate, right?
[4881.04s -> 4882.96s]  On me, I book same day.
[4884.56s -> 4886.16s]  I have to book next day fine.
[4886.16s -> 4892.80s]  But the data says that the show rate for same day is about 80%.
[4892.80s -> 4895.20s]  Show rate for next day is about 50%.
[4895.20s -> 4897.76s]  Show rate for 48 hours is about 20%.
[4899.84s -> 4902.48s]  So if I'm booking a Zoom appointment two days from now,
[4904.40s -> 4905.20s]  not going to happen.
[4905.84s -> 4909.52s]  And, oh, JT who was on this call that just ducked away.
[4909.52s -> 4916.24s]  We had some talks about booking out and I was taught this.
[4916.24s -> 4918.00s]  Take it away, right?
[4918.00s -> 4920.08s]  Well, I can only meet Saturday.
[4920.08s -> 4924.32s]  Oh, man, I got about 100 families to protect here in Burlington County.
[4924.32s -> 4927.04s]  They're only allowing me to book later today or tomorrow.
[4927.76s -> 4928.96s]  So I'm terribly sorry.
[4929.76s -> 4933.36s]  Looks like we'll have to reach out to you the next time that we're in the area.
[4934.24s -> 4936.48s]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I need to get this done.
[4936.48s -> 4937.36s]  How about tomorrow?
[4939.68s -> 4940.40s]  Go ahead, JT.
[4940.40s -> 4941.84s]  What was that like when that happened?
[4944.72s -> 4946.64s]  Actually, that was amazing.
[4946.64s -> 4951.04s]  I was super uncomfortable saying that at first and you told me to try it
[4951.04s -> 4953.68s]  and the very next chance that I did, I applied it.
[4953.68s -> 4955.28s]  And immediately they stayed on the phone.
[4955.28s -> 4958.72s]  I thought they were going to hang out right then because I told the take away.
[4958.72s -> 4960.08s]  As far as taking away that appointment,
[4960.08s -> 4962.08s]  you know, I'd love to call you back, but I can't.
[4962.16s -> 4965.68s]  I'm seeing 14 people tomorrow, and I'm just not going to have the time to do it
[4965.68s -> 4968.32s]  because I'm going to be giving everybody 100 percent of my attention.
[4968.96s -> 4971.68s]  And as soon as I said that, they instantly said,
[4971.68s -> 4973.76s]  okay, fine, I'll take a few minutes to answer your questions.
[4975.04s -> 4975.68s]  Hi, Karen.
[4975.68s -> 4976.64s]  Thanks for being here.
[4976.64s -> 4979.12s]  Listen, here's what's interesting, right?
[4979.68s -> 4983.36s]  The, I've been on the dial team for the legal organization.
[4985.84s -> 4991.04s]  Some of you guys are dialing with such weak tones of language.
[4992.08s -> 4998.08s]  Just imagine how much stronger that group would be with conviction, right?
[4998.08s -> 5003.84s]  I'm grateful and excited to get to know the Bayley organization and some of the folks
[5003.84s -> 5008.96s]  that we've met here today and to, you know, Tim, I meant what I said.
[5008.96s -> 5012.16s]  Let me put my phone number here in the chat box for Tim only.
[5014.72s -> 5020.32s]  But, yeah, sorry, this thing happened when like my name got on the leaderboards
[5020.32s -> 5022.48s]  and then like three, four people a day are calling me.
[5022.48s -> 5024.88s]  And I can't say no, I have problems with that.
[5024.88s -> 5027.28s]  And then all of a sudden, my business goes up and smoke.
[5027.28s -> 5028.08s]  It's the truth.
[5028.08s -> 5028.72s]  It's happened.
[5028.72s -> 5032.16s]  I've had, you ever had Melissa Weagle yell at you about that?
[5032.16s -> 5033.20s]  I certainly have.
[5033.20s -> 5034.80s]  So, here you go.
[5036.88s -> 5037.92s]  Here you go, Tim.
[5037.92s -> 5038.80s]  That's my phone number.
[5041.44s -> 5043.60s]  Yeah, I'm looking forward to meeting you guys.
[5043.60s -> 5047.04s]  But this is about conviction and belief.
[5047.92s -> 5050.80s]  And conviction and belief is not born of weak language.
[5051.36s -> 5053.04s]  It's not born of weak talent.
[5054.00s -> 5063.92s]  You feel that, by brook, you feel that, oh, I don't know what brook's talking about,
[5063.92s -> 5064.88s]  having spent time with me.
[5067.04s -> 5069.68s]  You feel that letter out and send it back.
[5070.24s -> 5072.40s]  And I'm the one who's been assigned to your case.
[5073.04s -> 5076.80s]  So, I just need to get this completed so we can get those options.
[5077.84s -> 5078.80s]  You feel the letter out.
[5079.52s -> 5080.88s]  I've been assigned to your case.
[5080.88s -> 5082.32s]  Oh, Melissa Weagle yelling at you.
[5084.32s -> 5088.72s]  I would venture to guess 90% of the people on this call have been yelled at by Melissa Weagle.
[5090.72s -> 5091.68s]  It's conviction.
[5091.68s -> 5092.40s]  It's tone.
[5093.52s -> 5094.16s]  It's belief.
[5096.40s -> 5098.64s]  Look, I know we only have four more minutes.
[5098.64s -> 5101.20s]  I want you to reflect on this the next time you make a dial.
[5104.00s -> 5106.24s]  What would you do or say differently?
[5107.44s -> 5112.24s]  If when you hung up, the person they most love died.
[5115.36s -> 5120.72s]  If you knew you had to convince them to meet with you, because if you hung up,
[5122.32s -> 5126.08s]  the person they most love was going to die later that day.
[5126.88s -> 5129.52s]  What would you do or say differently?
[5129.92s -> 5137.76s]  All right, let's focus on that thing here instead of all chatting about Melissa Weagle and her tone.
[5138.48s -> 5139.12s]  Let's focus.
[5140.88s -> 5146.80s]  What would you do or say differently if when you hung up,
[5148.32s -> 5153.44s]  that person they wanted to protect or them was going to die?
[5153.60s -> 5157.28s]  Would you push?
[5158.80s -> 5162.96s]  Would you get them to say, I know this is being recorded.
[5162.96s -> 5164.88s]  Don't ever fucking call me again.
[5165.92s -> 5167.12s]  Would you get them to say that?
[5169.20s -> 5169.60s]  Why not?
[5171.60s -> 5172.00s]  Why not?
[5173.20s -> 5174.72s]  You think that's a bad thing?
[5174.72s -> 5175.68s]  That's not a bad thing.
[5176.24s -> 5178.00s]  That means I've done all I can for you.
[5179.44s -> 5180.40s]  It's not a bad thing.
[5181.28s -> 5182.08s]  It's a good thing.
[5183.52s -> 5184.64s]  All right, now consider this.
[5186.56s -> 5192.40s]  What would you do or say differently if when you hung up, the person you loved the most was
[5192.40s -> 5192.88s]  going to die?
[5200.32s -> 5202.00s]  Now what would you do or say differently?
[5203.68s -> 5204.80s]  How hard would you push?
[5206.64s -> 5212.72s]  And could you hang up and feel okay that they rejected you with some pretty strong and
[5212.72s -> 5213.52s]  terse language?
[5215.52s -> 5220.56s]  And when was the last time a telemarketer called you and you got pissed off
[5221.76s -> 5226.72s]  and didn't realize on the other side of that phone with someone making 12 bucks an hour,
[5226.72s -> 5233.36s]  single mom, three kids just looking to put food on the table and you got pissed off at them.
[5235.68s -> 5236.40s]  And guess what?
[5236.40s -> 5239.60s]  People in India, there are single moms with three kids.
[5239.68s -> 5242.64s]  So the next time you get a person calling you from India and you're like,
[5242.64s -> 5244.64s]  don't sell me shit and you hang up.
[5244.64s -> 5248.08s]  Don't forget you did the same thing that you don't like.
[5251.84s -> 5254.08s]  Now most of them sound like telemarketers.
[5254.08s -> 5256.40s]  Hey, Melanie, how are you?
[5256.40s -> 5257.44s]  This is so and so.
[5259.44s -> 5261.84s]  In a couple of times we just did it in this thing.
[5261.84s -> 5262.56s]  I didn't do that.
[5263.12s -> 5263.52s]  It was like,
[5264.48s -> 5266.08s]  Hi, Kristen.
[5266.08s -> 5269.76s]  This is Keith Fonsega calling from the mortgage protection department about your loan with
[5269.76s -> 5274.08s]  Wells Fargo back when you closed on the most recent loan for 200,000.
[5274.08s -> 5277.12s]  We sent you a letter regarding your mortgage protection options,
[5277.12s -> 5280.48s]  which could pay off your mortgage if you got sick or if you died.
[5281.20s -> 5283.36s]  You fill that letter out and mail it back to us.
[5283.36s -> 5285.76s]  And I'm the field underwriter has been assigned to your case.
[5286.72s -> 5288.16s]  I got a private request.
[5289.76s -> 5292.24s]  Talk about your schedules like for same day appointments.
[5293.60s -> 5295.76s]  A call in the morning and a book in the afternoon.
[5295.76s -> 5298.24s]  That's the Tim Pensa organization does that.
[5298.24s -> 5298.88s]  They taught me that.
[5298.88s -> 5300.32s]  I'm in an office with that.
[5300.32s -> 5303.20s]  A call from nine to noon and I booked them in the afternoon.
[5303.20s -> 5305.12s]  If I didn't book enough, I keep dialing.
[5306.40s -> 5307.12s]  Easy peasy.
[5309.20s -> 5312.56s]  All right, Melissa, you said one o'clock noon central.
[5314.16s -> 5315.20s]  That is correct, sir.
[5315.84s -> 5320.32s]  So any final wrap-ups that people may have or you yourself might have would be
[5320.32s -> 5322.88s]  absolutely fantastic, but thank you, Keith.
[5322.88s -> 5326.64s]  I mean, you've kept the attention of 50 individuals for an hour and a half.
[5326.64s -> 5329.44s]  I can usually only manage to do that for like seven minutes.
[5329.44s -> 5334.72s]  So I appreciate your time and candor and your jokes and intelligence.
[5334.72s -> 5338.40s]  But any final statements for Mr. Keith or vice versa.
[5338.96s -> 5341.60s]  Besides our extreme gratitude and appreciation.
[5343.76s -> 5346.88s]  I just want to say thank you so much for sharing with all of us.
[5346.88s -> 5348.88s]  We definitely appreciate your time.
[5348.88s -> 5350.72s]  This was incredibly valuable.
[5350.72s -> 5351.44s]  Thank you so much.
[5352.80s -> 5353.68s]  Thank you, Keith.
[5353.68s -> 5355.68s]  I appreciate you and all you've done.
[5355.68s -> 5359.68s]  And I know my team is very grateful.
[5360.72s -> 5361.20s]  I'm so in.
[5361.20s -> 5362.64s]  Keith, can you show that postcard again?
[5362.64s -> 5365.60s]  I know Michelle Roqueo had a quick question about that.
[5365.60s -> 5370.00s]  So if you don't mind holding up that postcard that you have that you're stating.
[5375.92s -> 5377.20s]  Can you see that, Michelle?
[5377.20s -> 5379.84s]  How hold it up if people want to take a screenshot of that?
[5379.84s -> 5381.28s]  Then you can just take that quick.
[5382.40s -> 5383.36s]  Thank you so much.
[5383.36s -> 5384.96s]  Hopefully that gave them enough time.
[5386.40s -> 5387.68s]  This is about dialing.
[5388.24s -> 5389.68s]  What's in front of me is hard.
[5390.48s -> 5392.08s]  And I can do hard things.
[5393.68s -> 5394.16s]  Thank you.
[5394.96s -> 5395.92s]  Yeah, thanks, Michelle.
[5395.92s -> 5396.80s]  Thanks for reminding us.
[5397.60s -> 5401.04s]  So okay, well, I'm going to pause on the recording.
[5401.04s -> 5403.76s]  Thank you all for being on and a special.
[5403.76s -> 5404.56s]  Thank you, obviously.
