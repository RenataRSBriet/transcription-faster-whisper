[0.00s -> 6.80s]  We'll try to do, we'll try to do just like a half an hour
[6.80s -> 9.76s]  meeting today and we'll try another half an hour on Friday
[9.76s -> 10.96s]  and we'll see how it works.
[10.96s -> 17.16s]  And then what I'm going to do is I'm going to narrate
[17.16s -> 21.12s]  the PowerPoints so that when you download the PowerPoints
[21.12s -> 26.12s]  on Canvas, basically, it'll be just me kind of walking
[26.12s -> 29.36s]  through those PowerPoints narrated, too.
[29.36s -> 32.92s]  So these sessions will just go over kind of if you got questions
[32.92s -> 37.80s]  in just the main face, a couple of times a week, all right?
[37.80s -> 40.92s]  But it's not like we're all doing anything else,
[40.92s -> 43.88s]  except kind of hanging out by our computers anyway,
[43.88s -> 45.72s]  or our funds or whatever.
[45.72s -> 46.60s]  I hope everybody's good.
[49.60s -> 51.64s]  I hope you're not bored.
[51.64s -> 53.84s]  And I hope you're staying safe.
[54.28s -> 57.28s]  All right.
[57.28s -> 59.56s]  I know that it's a weird time.
[59.56s -> 61.08s]  I'm not seeing all you guys.
[61.08s -> 62.72s]  So this is kind of cool, all right?
[62.72s -> 66.88s]  So let's try this out.
[66.88s -> 68.80s]  So I'm going to start sharing my screen here
[68.80s -> 73.28s]  and then we're going to go in here and then see what you guys
[73.28s -> 76.24s]  what you guys can do, all right?
[76.24s -> 76.64s]  Thank you.
[76.64s -> 78.32s]  Thumbs up from some people, yeah?
[78.32s -> 79.08s]  Good?
[79.08s -> 79.56s]  Okay, good.
[79.56s -> 80.36s]  All right, awesome.
[80.36s -> 82.96s]  Here we go.
[82.96s -> 83.80s]  What else is that?
[83.80s -> 85.24s]  Yeah, what else is out there?
[85.24s -> 86.96s]  All right, good stuff.
[86.96s -> 87.48s]  Good stuff.
[87.48s -> 88.96s]  All right, so I'm sharing the screen.
[88.96s -> 92.32s]  And let's do that.
[92.32s -> 97.32s]  Now let's go to see if you guys can't see the PowerPoint
[101.24s -> 104.32s]  that's going to come up soon here.
[104.32s -> 105.16s]  Cool.
[108.68s -> 110.52s]  You guys got that.
[110.52s -> 112.16s]  Can you kind of see the PowerPoint?
[113.96s -> 114.96s]  All right.
[118.96s -> 124.60s]  Let's go with that.
[124.60s -> 126.28s]  I want to start at the beginning.
[126.28s -> 132.72s]  So basically guys, it's the next 15 minutes or so.
[132.72s -> 136.44s]  I just want to go over kind of what we're doing here
[136.44s -> 142.44s]  in terms of learning objectives and some other things
[142.44s -> 146.68s]  we're going to be going on, all right?
[146.68s -> 151.24s]  I'm going to unmute who can unmute here?
[151.24s -> 154.76s]  Let's do all right, Grace.
[154.76s -> 156.84s]  Can you see what I'm doing on the screen?
[161.04s -> 162.64s]  What's that Grace?
[162.64s -> 163.84s]  Yeah, I can see.
[163.84s -> 165.40s]  I'm just going to put up.
[165.40s -> 168.00s]  All right.
[168.00s -> 168.68s]  Good stuff.
[168.68s -> 171.80s]  All right, good talking to you.
[171.80s -> 174.08s]  Hey, Eeks.
[174.08s -> 180.80s]  KB said to that she says that she's still waiting.
[180.80s -> 183.64s]  OK, I'll go letter in.
[183.64s -> 186.96s]  Thanks, Tom.
[186.96s -> 187.46s]  Cool.
[190.44s -> 192.88s]  I guess I got to stop.
[192.88s -> 194.16s]  I got to pause the share.
[198.64s -> 200.44s]  Like I said, there's going to be some hiccups today.
[200.44s -> 210.20s]  Like getting this thing all how the hell do I let people in?
[210.20s -> 214.12s]  One person is waiting, all right?
[214.12s -> 215.44s]  Maybe that hopefully out of letter in.
[220.60s -> 223.68s]  And maybe instead of like a waiting room on Friday,
[223.68s -> 227.08s]  I'll just once you join, you're just going to get in.
[227.08s -> 229.48s]  So I don't have to keep letting everybody in.
[231.44s -> 239.56s]  So, all right, let's, like I said, I'm recording this too.
[239.56s -> 244.40s]  So if you can't get in right now, you can look at it later.
[244.40s -> 249.08s]  So let's go back and let's look at the PowerPoint here.
[249.08s -> 253.68s]  And like I said, guys, all the learning objectives remain the same.
[253.68s -> 257.80s]  OK, you got to focus on our W's.
[257.80s -> 262.92s]  All right, we got to get, you make sure that yourself motivated.
[262.92s -> 271.44s]  All right, these next five weeks are going to be different, odd in some ways,
[271.44s -> 273.12s]  but kind of similar in other ways.
[273.12s -> 277.52s]  I'm just trying to keep this as normal as possible.
[277.52s -> 281.88s]  OK, so I'm not going to be hovering over you like a vulture,
[281.88s -> 284.00s]  like making sure you're doing stuff every single day.
[284.00s -> 289.64s]  So you got to kind of be on your own a little bit with some of the stuff.
[289.64s -> 293.08s]  All right, like I said, I'm going to be narrating the PowerPoint.
[293.08s -> 297.48s]  So you're going to have all the notes on stuff at your disposal.
[297.48s -> 303.60s]  But the big thing is that you are kind of keeping up your end of the bargain on it.
[303.60s -> 308.96s]  All right, and it's, you know, it's just kind of is what it is.
[308.96s -> 313.48s]  All right, so basically what we're going to do
[313.48s -> 317.76s]  is they're probably probably be more videos.
[317.76s -> 323.84s]  OK, there are probably more, you know, a couple more handouts.
[323.84s -> 328.76s]  But like I said, they're going to be the same kind of videos.
[328.76s -> 333.40s]  Five, 10 minutes here and there and they figure out how we're going to do it.
[333.40s -> 336.96s]  So combine all those, the quizzes are going to remain the same.
[336.96s -> 340.96s]  I'll explain to you when those quizzes are going to be happening.
[340.96s -> 344.72s]  We got two more quizzes coming up.
[344.72s -> 348.12s]  So and then we're going to have the same thing to same thing with those quizzes.
[348.12s -> 354.32s]  You'll have basically five, six, seven days to work on them and determine them whenever.
[354.32s -> 357.64s]  So everything's staying the same except.
[357.64s -> 359.56s]  We're just not meeting in person.
[359.56s -> 367.24s]  All right, and then last, but not least, I am, please send me questions and thoughts.
[367.24s -> 373.56s]  OK, that's really all we're kind of what I want to do is I want to kind of make sure
[373.56s -> 377.32s]  that this is as friendly as possible for you.
[377.32s -> 382.28s]  And so I'm a big believer in constructive criticism.
[382.28s -> 385.68s]  So if you don't like something or you want me to change something or whatever,
[385.68s -> 390.36s]  you know, be nice, but send me messages.
[390.36s -> 393.72s]  OK, don't be mean to me, because then it upsets me and I cry.
[393.72s -> 405.96s]  OK, so here's what I want to do, OK, we're at about the getting close to the 15 minute mark
[405.96s -> 406.96s]  for our meeting today.
[406.96s -> 409.68s]  And we're only going to be here, like I said, for half an hour.
[409.68s -> 415.68s]  So what I want to do is just like we do in class, take two, three minutes and just kind
[415.68s -> 421.96s]  of jot down or write down on your notebooks and your phones wherever you're using note,
[421.96s -> 424.24s]  you know, anything.
[424.24s -> 428.80s]  When you see the word nationalism, what do you think of?
[428.80s -> 432.12s]  All right, so let's just do, like I said, two, three minutes on that.
[432.12s -> 438.36s]  And like I said, it's odd and it's bizarre and you're by yourself and you're in a room
[438.36s -> 447.00s]  and just kind of imagine that you're in a classroom, OK, it's kind of the best way to do it.
[447.00s -> 454.40s]  And see if anything comes to mind when you think of nationalism, write some things down.
[454.40s -> 461.56s]  I want to, I'm going to stop sharing here in a minute and then we're going to use the chat feature.
[461.56s -> 466.44s]  OK, so if you got some ideas, I'm going to stop sharing that right now.
[466.44s -> 471.80s]  And if you got some, some things, you can start putting in on the chat feature over here
[471.80s -> 476.16s]  on the right, like for instance, when I think of nationalism,
[476.16s -> 484.56s]  I think of, I think of nationalism, I think, for some reason, for me, I think of songs.
[484.56s -> 489.96s]  All right, I think of songs, I think of national anthems.
[489.96s -> 491.92s]  Was that a cool start?
[491.92s -> 499.04s]  OK, so if you guys got any other ones, use the Zoom feature over there,
[499.04s -> 505.60s]  that the chat feature, sorry, and we'll see if we can't get some of these going here.
[506.16s -> 522.16s]  Oh, it's nice seeing everybody. It really is national flags. It's a good one.
[522.16s -> 528.12s]  It's a good one.
[528.12s -> 533.16s]  Culture pride. I like it.
[533.16s -> 538.12s]  These are all things I'm going to put in the PowerPoint.
[538.12s -> 549.16s]  OK, once we get done with our session today, I'm going to put these suggestions in the PowerPoint.
[549.16s -> 551.40s]  Well, I like that one.
[551.40s -> 556.92s]  This, you said, sometimes can be bigots.
[556.92s -> 558.72s]  What is that? I'm going to unmute you for a minute.
[558.72s -> 560.68s]  What do you mean by that?
[560.68s -> 565.88s]  Like, kind of like white supremacism, how that can turn into nationalism,
[565.88s -> 568.56s]  where they think that they're better than everybody else?
[568.56s -> 574.36s]  Yeah, that's awesome. That's a great one.
[574.36s -> 581.56s]  And so one of the things we're going to look at with nationalism is sometimes you can get really ugly.
[581.56s -> 589.28s]  For instance, you guys were little, but after 9-11, all right, it happened.
[589.28s -> 591.64s]  And you guys, like I said, it gets a little.
[591.64s -> 598.20s]  There was this explosion of all kinds of songs about patriotism and things.
[598.20s -> 601.64s]  And a lot of them were written by Toby Keith.
[601.64s -> 605.80s]  And if you're told I'm not crappin' on Toby Keith, you're a Toby Keith fan.
[605.80s -> 607.76s]  But there were a couple of songs.
[607.76s -> 613.48s]  I remember a couple of them where it was like, if you don't like America,
[613.48s -> 618.52s]  or the near terrorist, and Toby Keith was going to shove a boot in your ass,
[618.52s -> 620.64s]  because that's the American way.
[620.64s -> 623.68s]  You know, those types of songs, you know what I mean?
[623.68s -> 628.64s]  So that definitely is a big aspect of it, all right.
[628.64s -> 630.60s]  And like, Bish said, that's a great point.
[630.60s -> 634.08s]  It can get ugly quickly.
[634.08s -> 637.44s]  So that's a really good one.
[637.44s -> 639.88s]  We'll talk about a lot of those good points going forward.
[639.88s -> 643.68s]  Patriotic feelings, I like that.
[643.68s -> 649.16s]  Jared says social values.
[649.16s -> 652.36s]  Jared, what do you mean by social values?
[652.36s -> 658.40s]  It's kind of what Hannah said earlier about white supremacists and stuff like that.
[658.40s -> 664.88s]  Kind of like, I don't know, I can't think of an example.
[664.88s -> 665.88s]  Okay.
[665.88s -> 670.44s]  Just like culture is kind of like what everyone else is saying, too.
[670.48s -> 677.48s]  I'm going to write in a thing here on the chat where it says, we're all on the same team.
[677.48s -> 680.00s]  Okay.
[680.00s -> 687.32s]  I think that's definitely an aspect of nationalism where you try to
[687.32s -> 695.12s]  see what binds us all together, culturally, with our values and those types of things.
[695.12s -> 699.40s]  A big one here that I'm going to write down, okay, is that
[699.52s -> 705.84s]  we just got done with this when we all went on break.
[705.84s -> 713.72s]  But nationalism is really, really, really romantic, okay.
[713.72s -> 720.44s]  It's a really romantic idea that we're all the same and we're all together
[720.44s -> 726.32s]  and we all want to be a part of a bigger team, okay.
[726.32s -> 733.04s]  It's a really, really interesting idea for a lot of people, okay.
[733.04s -> 740.00s]  And like I said, next week when we keep this up,
[740.00s -> 744.00s]  we're going to do what's called, I want to do a thing called National Anthem Week.
[744.00s -> 751.40s]  And we're going to listen to a bunch of different national anthems from all over the world.
[751.40s -> 754.28s]  Okay, we're going to listen to ours, we're going to listen to Italy's.
[754.28s -> 759.64s]  We're going to listen to England's and France's and Germany's.
[759.64s -> 763.76s]  And you're going to start reading these national anthems and you're going to be like,
[763.76s -> 773.00s]  that's a little violent and harsh and different than ours.
[773.00s -> 776.80s]  You may have opinions on our national anthem, but our national anthem bind large
[776.80s -> 779.44s]  when we get into this next week.
[779.44s -> 786.00s]  Ours is really tame and it's really nondescript and it's kind of general.
[786.00s -> 790.40s]  And some of these national anthems are going to be reading, you're going to be like, yikes.
[790.40s -> 794.36s]  Alright, so next time you hear the Olympics or you watch a soccer game
[794.36s -> 798.24s]  where they all get together and they blink arms and they sing their national anthems,
[798.24s -> 801.24s]  you know, some of the words that you never understood before, you're going to be like,
[801.24s -> 811.68s]  okay, that's pretty harsh in some cases and violent, okay.
[811.68s -> 817.48s]  Yeah, these are good, these are good, I like a lot of these suggestions, okay.
[817.48s -> 820.36s]  So we've got about, we've got about 10 minutes left.
[820.36s -> 825.60s]  Alright, so I'm going to go back and I'm going to share, those are good, that was a good, good group chat.
[825.64s -> 832.04s]  I'm going to go back and I'm going to share what we're looking at here with the PowerPoint, okay.
[832.04s -> 835.68s]  So we got some good chat features out there.
[835.68s -> 843.28s]  Alright, we got some good chat features out there and we'll use those going forward.
[843.28s -> 847.64s]  Alright, so where are we?
[847.64s -> 854.36s]  Let's just kind of literally reset the map, okay.
[854.40s -> 862.16s]  Basically where we are and because this is a world history class and not an American history class
[862.16s -> 867.40s]  and we got to kind of move decently quickly over the next five weeks.
[867.40s -> 872.92s]  Let's just assume that the American revolution has happened, okay.
[872.92s -> 879.28s]  We would have went over it a little bit in class but we just got to zoom past it, okay.
[879.32s -> 890.44s]  So the American revolution has happened in 1776 and then by 1800, the United States is an actual thing, okay.
[890.44s -> 897.64s]  We have separated ourselves from Great Britain and created a brand new nation.
[897.64s -> 906.88s]  So that is no matter what you think about it, okay, about America and it just let's get out of that for a minute.
[906.88s -> 920.88s]  That's really, really, really inspirational to a lot of countries around the world that, hey, I can, we can form up our national anthem, okay.
[920.88s -> 925.96s]  And we can form up our own culture and those types of things, okay.
[925.96s -> 926.88s]  Does that make sense?
[927.88s -> 942.88s]  So imagine that you're in a place like France or Spain or some of these other areas, Germany, et cetera, and Italy that you're basically saying, I want my own country too.
[942.88s -> 947.88s]  I want us to have our own place on the map.
[947.88s -> 954.88s]  So basically what the French people do and this is where we're going to start here with France.
[954.88s -> 962.88s]  Basically what the French people do in the late 1700s is they have their own revolution very much inspired by the American revolution.
[962.88s -> 968.88s]  They, in fact, even bring over guys from the United States revolution.
[968.88s -> 978.88s]  The two big ones are Ben Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, they bring them over to France and basically ask them, how do you guys do it?
[978.88s -> 987.88s]  What are some of the things that you guys did with the American revolution and what are some of the things that we should put into our new government, okay.
[987.88s -> 989.88s]  So the French have this revolution.
[989.88s -> 994.88s]  All right, you can read about it in your book right before the stuff on the polling.
[994.88s -> 1001.88s]  And so if you want to read a little bit about the French revolution, it's in the 650s of your book, okay.
[1001.88s -> 1008.88s]  But basically the bottom line is this the French have a revolution and they overthrow their king.
[1008.88s -> 1016.88s]  All right, his name was Louis the 16th they overthrow their can I'm not going to ask you on the next quiz who Louis the 16th is.
[1016.88s -> 1018.88s]  Okay, so we're not going to do that.
[1018.88s -> 1034.88s]  But the French overthrow their king, they take him and his wife, very famous coin named Marie Antoinette and they chop their heads off in a really ugly and awful violent way, okay.
[1034.88s -> 1041.88s]  And they literally chop off the head of the state and start a new state, okay.
[1041.88s -> 1053.88s]  When that happens and unleashes all kinds of new stuff in France and everybody wants to have their own opinions on what's going to be this new government, okay.
[1053.88s -> 1082.88s]  Well, the long and short of it is that it unleashes a brand new upwardly mobile society where people that never used to count or from the lower classes were able to work their way up to the top by either becoming a really good merchant or in the next guy's case that we're going to look at becoming really good at military and really good at war.
[1082.88s -> 1088.88s]  Okay, and that's where all these new people start making their names for themselves in France, okay.
[1088.88s -> 1105.88s]  And so the French Revolution has some good things and has some bad things to it. And so the big thing we're going to get into as we click to the next screen is we're going to look at this guy named Napoleon because Napoleon is the guy that kicks off this whole thing known as nationalism.
[1105.88s -> 1119.88s]  Okay, so again, we talked about the American Revolution is inspiration, right. And here is Napoleon, a picture of Napoleon, okay.
[1119.88s -> 1129.88s]  Basically, get the bio, the big bio stuff on Napoleon from that handout and stuff that I gave you in the videos, okay.
[1129.88s -> 1144.88s]  Where he's from, you know, how he grew up and those types of things that's all important, but the big thing with Napoleon, right, is that he achieved prominence as a military guy.
[1144.88s -> 1152.88s]  And he achieved prominence, he grew up through the system as a military guy.
[1152.88s -> 1166.88s]  So he gets into power, okay. And your book talks about how he gets in the power and establishes himself as a, you know, as a counselor on page 661, right.
[1166.88s -> 1175.88s]  But the big thing is that once he gets into power, he starts establishing his own government, right, which is the big thing on page 661 and the polionic code.
[1175.88s -> 1179.88s]  Okay, that's the thing I want you guys to look at with that definition.
[1179.88s -> 1192.88s]  And basically what it did is as it says with definition, it promotes the equality of all male citizens. That's the big thing, male citizens, right.
[1192.88s -> 1200.88s]  Women lose a lot of legal rights when Napoleon takes power, okay.
[1200.88s -> 1210.88s]  Basically what Napoleon was is he was a guy that believed that the French Revolution went a little too far in giving everybody rights.
[1210.88s -> 1216.88s]  And basically what he's doing is he's having a conservative reaction to it. And he's like, that's too equal.
[1216.88s -> 1227.88s]  Men and women are not going to be equal under the law. So basically what does is he kind of cuts off a lot of women's rights and institutes these for only men.
[1227.88s -> 1239.88s]  And secondly, all right, we talk about this. He secures the wealth and the private property of the really wealthy people in France. And that's big, okay.
[1239.88s -> 1249.88s]  Because what he does is he then takes those wealthy people and he says, me and you together, the money and the military, we're going to be in charge now.
[1249.88s -> 1259.88s]  Okay, the money and the military are going to be in charge. And that's big for our world because this is basically a word that I want you to write down your books. It's called fascism.
[1259.88s -> 1275.88s]  It's spelled F-A-S-C-I-S-M. Okay, fascism. And when the money and the military get together, it creates a really bizarrely ugly situation in many countries.
[1275.88s -> 1287.88s]  And the French live this out with Napoleon. Okay, so I'm going to stop sharing here. We got two minutes left. All right, here on these things.
[1287.88s -> 1295.88s]  All right, and basically, like I said, this is going to be how we're going to run these things, hopefully three times a week.
[1295.88s -> 1309.88s]  Like I understand, Eastern stuff is coming up, so I'm not going to make you guys do all these things during holiday weeks and things like that. But like I said, these are going to be our little sessions that we're going to try to get out.
[1309.88s -> 1323.88s]  All right, so the rest of that PowerPoint, I'm going to narrate it here in the next hour or so, and then I'll publish it to Canvas. Is that cool? Yeah, everybody go with that.
[1323.88s -> 1345.88s]  Thumbs up. All right. And then when we get back in here on Friday, I'll send you another invitation. We'll come back in at 11, 15 on Friday. We'll kind of go over some more of the things. And then we'll really get into how Napoleon makes other countries upset by taking them over.
[1345.88s -> 1362.88s]  And then they start reacting against him. And what it does is, is when the other countries react against Napoleon, it blows up with nationalism. Everybody says, I want my own country, I want Italy, I want Spain, I want Germany, etc.
[1362.88s -> 1369.88s]  Does that make sense, everybody? All right, so everybody's going to want their own country coming up pretty soon.
[1369.88s -> 1379.88s]  Okay, and that's kind of Napoleon kicks that all off when he starts taking over and invading other places, I'll go over that in the notes. Cool.
[1379.88s -> 1382.88s]  Good. All right.
[1382.88s -> 1388.88s]  So yeah, I'm just looking at some of the chats. Yeah, the definition.
[1388.88s -> 1393.88s]  If you're looking at those definitions, 661 is cool. Cool, you.
[1393.88s -> 1395.88s]  Awesome.
[1395.88s -> 1398.88s]  Everybody good?
[1398.88s -> 1403.88s]  Good. I think that was good for the first day. I think that was good for the first day.
[1403.88s -> 1417.88s]  Like I said, I will put that out in a PowerPoint fashion here in a little bit, and then I'll see everybody back in here on Friday at 11, 15.
[1417.88s -> 1419.88s]  Awesome.
[1419.88s -> 1431.88s]  All right, guys, have a great day. Be safe. Okay. See you.
