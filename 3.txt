[143.88s -> 144.88s]  Aye.
[144.88s -> 145.88s]  Thank you very much.
[145.88s -> 146.88s]  Okay.
[146.88s -> 147.88s]  Policy.
[147.88s -> 149.88s]  Next item on the agenda.
[149.88s -> 160.20s]  Okay, well, good morning, Chair and members of the board for the record.
[160.20s -> 167.28s]  My name is Ann Thompson and the policy analyst for the behavior analysis regulatory board.
[167.28s -> 172.04s]  If I can get you in the way back machine for just a bit, the reason we're here is we
[172.04s -> 180.52s]  had rules that came about from House Bill 2421 in the 2023 session that required the
[180.52s -> 187.32s]  board to adopt professional methods and procedures for interventionists that were registered with
[187.32s -> 189.84s]  the board and the HLO.
[189.84s -> 194.00s]  So a little over a year ago, I brought a rule to you.
[194.00s -> 200.32s]  The finished rule that we talked about is on slide 23 if you're following along.
[200.32s -> 207.34s]  Had a rack in May, got some feedback from the board in December and put the rule out
[207.34s -> 209.56s]  for public comment.
[209.56s -> 217.60s]  The public comments were collected on, you can see on page 24, there were none.
[217.60s -> 220.56s]  And we had no one attend the hearing.
[220.56s -> 224.88s]  And essentially what this means is you got it right.
[224.88s -> 230.44s]  Everyone north, south, east, or west, urban, rural, big practice, small practice, interventionist,
[230.44s -> 233.88s]  looked at the rule and said we can live with that.
[233.88s -> 238.36s]  So with that being said, there's nothing to consider.
[238.36s -> 244.92s]  If the board would like to go ahead and adopt this permanent rule, I have it on the schedule
[244.92s -> 248.08s]  to become effective on the 15th of this month.
[248.08s -> 252.64s]  We like to make round figures, either the first of the month or halfway through, just
[252.64s -> 256.84s]  for the ease of documentation.
[256.84s -> 258.96s]  And that's all there is.
[258.96s -> 265.56s]  If we could get a motion, a second, and a roll call to adopt the permanent rule, unless
[265.56s -> 269.52s]  a member of the board has a question.
[269.52s -> 275.16s]  No questions?
[275.16s -> 279.72s]  This is Brenna, so moved.
[279.72s -> 280.72s]  Okay.
[280.72s -> 281.72s]  So Brenna.
[281.72s -> 282.72s]  Yeah.
[282.72s -> 283.72s]  Okay.
[283.72s -> 286.72s]  We have a second.
[286.72s -> 292.84s]  This is done by a second.
[292.84s -> 294.80s]  Thank you, Corey.
[294.80s -> 299.48s]  If Megan, if we could get a roll call, aye or nay, please.
[299.48s -> 307.80s]  Megan Johns, aye, Jennifer White, aye, Brenna look up, oh, sorry, Brenna look hard.
[307.80s -> 308.80s]  Aye.
[308.80s -> 321.00s]  Samantha Parnam, aye, Marie McMahon, aye, Corey Stump, aye, and Brad Hendershot.
[321.00s -> 322.00s]  Aye.
[322.00s -> 331.16s]  Okay, that's it.
[331.16s -> 336.64s]  So essentially this rulemaking, I'm going to go ahead and file it with Secretary of State.
[336.64s -> 341.24s]  I'm going to notify the lawmakers this afternoon about the permanent rule.
[341.24s -> 349.72s]  I'm not sure when the communication will go out to interested parties, but the staff
[349.72s -> 351.96s]  should be able to get that out at the beginning of the week.
[351.96s -> 358.96s]  And I believe this is in the rear view mirror.
[358.96s -> 363.16s]  Oh, no, thank you all so much.
[363.16s -> 369.24s]  I mean, this is when rules go right, this is how they look, it's fantastic.
[369.24s -> 375.28s]  So Bob, unless you or another member of staff has any questions, we can just gavill out.
[375.28s -> 379.28s]  I don't have a question, but I like to wish everybody a great weekend.
[379.84s -> 381.04s]  Yes, absolutely.
[383.48s -> 384.48s]  Thank you.
[384.48s -> 385.48s]  Thanks, everybody.
[385.48s -> 386.48s]  You too.
[386.48s -> 387.48s]  Okay.
[387.48s -> 390.08s]  Well, if we could get an adjournment, please.
[390.08s -> 391.68s]  Thank you.
[391.68s -> 397.88s]  The behavior analysis regulatory report meeting is adjourned at 1141 AM.
[397.88s -> 401.12s]  Thank you all so very much for all your work on this.
[401.12s -> 403.12s]  Yes, thank you, everybody.
[403.12s -> 404.12s]  Thank you.
