[43.10s -> 46.54s]  disclosure of members interests do we have any today
[49.00s -> 51.48s]  no one we want item 4 late items
[52.80s -> 54.36s]  any late items
[54.36s -> 62.36s]  No late items, so confirmation of order of meeting. No changes, Ken?
[62.36s -> 70.36s]  No, I don't see any need for change. We do have a number of guests joining us at the meeting today.
[70.36s -> 76.36s]  But they're well aware of the time. So yes, I'm hoping they'll be here at the required time.
[76.36s -> 82.36s]  Happy to move in, Graham. Thanks, Graham. A seconder? A second, Susan.
[82.36s -> 88.36s]  Thanks, Susan. I think that was. Cheers. All in favour, please say aye.
[88.36s -> 100.36s]  I'm currently no carried. Okay, item six, which is confirmation of the minutes from 18 February.
[100.36s -> 108.36s]  We all take those as being read. Anything raised from those minutes?
[108.36s -> 116.36s]  Andrew Graham speaking. My diary is showing me that I was at that meeting, but my name's not recorded there.
[116.36s -> 122.36s]  Right. I was going to bring that up too, so I think there's some mistakes. Thanks Bruce.
[122.36s -> 128.36s]  Okay, so I'm sure we can have that remedy, Sam.
[128.36s -> 136.36s]  Yes, we'll make the changes. Thank you. Are you okay? So with that change, could I have a mover for the minutes to be received?
[136.36s -> 139.36s]  It's a true and correct request. Thank you, Marcus.
[139.36s -> 144.36s]  Seconder? I'll second it. Thanks, Bruce. All in favour, please say aye.
[144.36s -> 145.36s]  I. I.
[145.36s -> 148.36s]  Country no carried. Thank you.
[148.36s -> 153.36s]  Item seven, Jason. Has Jason joined us?
[153.36s -> 158.36s]  Yes. I see. Sam, not in my height, Jason. How are you doing?
[158.36s -> 163.36s]  Good. Thank you. Great. The floor is yours.
[163.36s -> 177.36s]  Okay. Sam, I don't think we had as we had issues with trying to get the presentation. Is that right? Oh, no. Sam is sharing. Brilliant.
[177.36s -> 180.36s]  Perfect.
[180.36s -> 192.36s]  Thanks, Sam. Good morning. Well, good afternoon. Sorry, everyone. Thanks for allowing me time just to give you a quick update on where we are as a sector for tourism, and particularly for white pad district.
[192.36s -> 202.36s]  So a report has obviously been provided to you and prepared which was our last six months performance at the end of 31st December 2019.
[202.36s -> 211.36s]  You would have seen why pad district council was going through significant growth, probably one of the fastest growing regions for us with regards to tourism impact.
[211.36s -> 218.36s]  You were experiencing double digit growth pretty much through visitor expenditure and also commercial accommodation.
[218.36s -> 229.36s]  But we are here today to discuss this, obviously, a bit of a change in the dynamic given COVID and the impact for tourism, particularly as a sector.
[229.36s -> 235.36s]  We can go to the next slide, Sam.
[235.36s -> 248.36s]  Perfect. So just first a couple of slides, obviously, just covering off some data. We're now receiving international and national data on a weekly basis from the government and also from the airlines.
[248.36s -> 259.36s]  It's a surprise, obviously, since COVID lockdown and international travel restrictions were put in place, international visitor arrivals into New Zealand has been have been dropping it at a very sharp rate.
[259.36s -> 274.36s]  We still do have airline connectivity, which I will go through because we are still maintaining what we call a baseline service for connections across the world, mainly for repatriation flights, but also for cargo and service across the country as well.
[274.36s -> 279.36s]  Next slide, Sam.
[279.36s -> 286.36s]  So weekly card transactions again, no surprise, obviously, overall our visitor expenditure is down significantly.
[286.36s -> 301.36s]  But when you do look on to the left top five, obviously food, liquor and pharmacies, we are still seeing some cumulative and some obviously weekly growth and expenditure compared to all our other visitor type of expenditure and transactions as well.
[301.36s -> 308.36s]  Sam.
[308.36s -> 322.36s]  So the impact for us as a sector, again, look, I mean, all of this has been reported, but just to cover off in summary, we were already impacted through the loss of China group travel, which started in the second to last week of January.
[322.36s -> 334.36s]  So with that, all of our international facing products, our hotels, our motels, our Airbnb's were immediately impacted by that because many of China group travel actually did stay in the White Cutswell.
[334.36s -> 341.36s]  They were our fourth largest international visitor market behind Australia, North America and UK Europe.
[341.36s -> 346.36s]  It did shut us down pretty much once international travel restrictions hit us.
[346.36s -> 359.36s]  And the visitor economy covers more than just the tourism operators, again, we've mentioned accommodation, it also impacts retail, hospitality, transport providers, our operators, of course, but also event organizers and major venues.
[359.36s -> 367.36s]  And of course, mystery creek of anti-trium and Lake Harapital, a key event platforms for white part district.
[367.36s -> 372.36s]  We have had significant job losses and business closures across tourism.
[372.36s -> 380.36s]  We have down underneath that last bullet point, look, the immediate business impact that we have been coaching our businesses through and helping them get through.
[380.36s -> 383.36s]  As some have gone into what we call temporary or seasonal closure.
[383.36s -> 393.36s]  So again, we have a lot of seasonality and tourism, many who would close for winter have closed, but those that potentially have never closed before, we've suggested they go into hibernation.
[393.36s -> 396.36s]  And so that's what we're calling temporary seasonal closures.
[396.36s -> 409.36s]  We've got a number of businesses, you know, Hobbiton was obviously one of the most public ones reported in the media, but again, all our motels, hotels, retail, hospitality, have pretty much reduced service and stuff.
[409.36s -> 419.36s]  There's only essential services operating as we know, but again, with alert level three, we do see some opening up, potentially in the hospitality sector for white power anyway.
[419.36s -> 432.36s]  So the last obviously implication for us as we have had a number of businesses who are permanently closing, not only are these are lost, definitely to the tourism industry to try and bring people back when we don't have products.
[432.36s -> 438.36s]  But also particularly for those vulnerable communities, where some of these operators have been going for many years.
[438.36s -> 442.36s]  Thanks, Sam.
[442.36s -> 444.36s]  Any questions about that?
[444.36s -> 445.36s]  Sure.
[445.36s -> 454.36s]  Have you got examples of what businesses are struggling and like what who isn't closing, but who is closing and how it is impacting around the wine industry?
[454.36s -> 463.36s]  Yeah, so particularly for white power, it has mainly been your hospitality, potentially some of your retail and also accommodation.
[463.36s -> 468.36s]  So we have had many nearly all of your accommodation has pretty much gone into hibernation or closure.
[468.36s -> 473.36s]  They're calling it temporary closure, but there's some of them have been able to access the wage subsidy, which is great.
[473.36s -> 482.36s]  But again, what we're going to see is the impacts are longer than the 12 week wage subsidy right now. So it's post 12 weeks what we're quite concerned about.
[482.36s -> 490.36s]  We have been lobbying nationally, the government and I think that's all sectors, not just tourism around potentially extending the wage subsidy for 20 weeks.
[490.36s -> 497.36s]  Because it will take a lot to restart the tourism sector again, people's propensity to travel is quite low.
[497.36s -> 513.36s]  We will travel locally and potentially we will travel intra regionally to stay within the region, but to try and stand up the domestic travel market is going to be a long haul that we're looking into six to 12 months recovery plan for that.
[513.36s -> 519.36s]  Great. So lastly, look, I mean, nothing else prior to you. This was just something we do for industry.
[519.36s -> 530.36s]  People know where we all fit. So from the tourism perspective when we respond, obviously we're providing industry support right now at a national level regional level and also at a local level.
[530.36s -> 542.36s]  But then we have to walk our chambers of commerce, our business associations and all local government have been great and actually supporting us with what we call the business and community support site for tourism businesses.
[542.36s -> 549.36s]  Lastly, we're obviously partnered with the Civil Defence Network around providing welfare support, not just for tourism operators.
[549.36s -> 561.36s]  Again, it's also been utilising tourism operators, many of our caterers have now been repurposed into providing food services, pretty much all supporting the food banks and actually cooking meals.
[561.36s -> 571.36s]  We also have a number of our transport operators and tourism being basically requisitions now to provide transport options and actually getting people around such as essential workers.
[571.36s -> 579.36s]  The staff potentially, we've been redeploying into the civil defence network through providing security and welfare and call centre as well.
[579.36s -> 594.36s]  So not only are we also working with civil defence, we're also putting staff into there as well.
[595.36s -> 606.36s]  Even though we're obviously dealing with COVID, this is just for you to be aware there are obviously continuing issues that we're going on with COVID and with the tourism industry.
[606.36s -> 613.36s]  First up was domestic airline connectivity. So look, New Zealand has been pretty open that they will not be restarting until a level one.
[613.36s -> 618.36s]  So we meet with New Zealand weekly just to see how we will try and stand the industry back up again.
[619.36s -> 625.36s]  They're going to focus very much what we call an incremental restart, so it's doing a width and breadth strategy across the country.
[625.36s -> 629.36s]  So potentially maybe only two or three flights into Hamilton per day.
[629.36s -> 640.36s]  But again, it's to try and get that reach across the whole network first before they can actually stand up and have a full schedule like we have seen out of Hamilton Airport particularly over the last three to four years.
[640.36s -> 646.36s]  Airline connectivity internationally is still continuing. So those are just some summary of some of the ones that are still flying.
[646.36s -> 651.36s]  So look, New Zealand are still connecting into North America and Hong Kong into Australia.
[651.36s -> 661.36s]  Fiji airlines are still flying into Fiji on a daily service in Qatar has probably used the most to try and repatriate northern hemisphere.
[661.36s -> 667.36s]  Travelers back to their homes through Qatar and then also Korean airlines are still operating a daily service as well.
[667.36s -> 672.36s]  For future again in New Zealand are saying they will be focusing very much on the domestic market first.
[672.36s -> 680.36s]  They will traditionally be a domestic airline for the first six to 12 months and domestic also includes Australia in the Pacific.
[680.36s -> 686.36s]  American Airlines so far have been the only one we've met with who plan to return to New Zealand from October 2020.
[686.36s -> 692.36s]  So they have put a stake in the ground to say when they will start flying into New Zealand again.
[692.36s -> 706.36s]  So the reason why I just raised international airline connectivity is because it will take this country at least two to five years before we ever go back to the type of connectivity we've had as a country previously before lockdown.
[706.36s -> 714.36s]  So again, it's going to be a very long burn for us as a country to regain the international visitor rivals we've seen in the past.
[714.36s -> 724.36s]  Yeah, traffic control services up for review. The reason why I just put that in there is just to let everyone know there was no wire cuts or airports or airfields but particularly Hamilton airport is an impacted.
[724.36s -> 732.36s]  But for us in the central North Island to do it is one that is going to be impacted around potentially the closure of air traffic control to other services.
[732.36s -> 737.36s]  That will mean potentially that we will be redo voting the domestic network through Toronto and Hamilton.
[737.36s -> 741.36s]  Unfortunately for Rotorua's last it could be our game.
[741.36s -> 749.36s]  And then lastly we've still got the investigation underway around for Cardi White Island so the work safe investigation should be going to a close shortly.
[749.36s -> 754.36s]  There will be impacts on the tourism and suppliers around adventure tourism for this country.
[754.36s -> 763.36s]  And also we will be awaiting Qualmark which is our accreditation program particularly around health and safety for the country.
[763.36s -> 767.36s]  Thanks Sam.
[767.36s -> 770.36s]  Just some of the data.
[770.36s -> 776.36s]  So we are now field days is going online so from the 30th of June for two weeks.
[776.36s -> 783.36s]  Field days will be providing a virtual exhibition space very similar to other international events who offer this type of experience.
[783.36s -> 787.36s]  Again it is a trial but we do hope to bring field days back in 2021.
[787.36s -> 794.36s]  Obviously not only is the largest major event for White Power but it's definitely for the White Cuttle with regards to economic impact.
[794.36s -> 801.36s]  We worked due to host New Zealand tourism awards in November that has been postponed until next year so we will reset the date for that.
[801.36s -> 806.36s]  Exploring trends these are what we call our two main international trade shows.
[806.36s -> 814.36s]  They've obviously been delayed trends 2021 which is the main time when we actually sell the White Cuttle to the world.
[814.36s -> 819.36s]  We will not be having until maybe June next year so it's just the waiting on a date for that.
[819.36s -> 831.36s]  Two major convention centres were due to open this year to Pi and Christchurch which potentially is the one that will be taking a lot of business away for us for for business events that has now been delayed for another year.
[831.36s -> 840.36s]  And of course in New Zealand international convention centre we will not know the reopening date of that until they work through the final insurance claims.
[840.36s -> 857.36s]  So again by having these two convention centres not operating means that places like Claudelyn's and the mystery creek event centre are going to be filling the gap for national and international conferences for the short term which is actually a good opportunity for us again as a region post COVID.
[857.36s -> 871.36s]  But we also do still have a vent planned so the major events obviously the National Walker Amazon is at this stage still plans to take take take effect and they cut up here and we also have our first major event for the region.
[871.36s -> 886.36s]  The ICC woman's cricket will cut scheduled for the 8th of February again this one will particularly be decided by around October November whether we see international travel restrictions have lifted to enable some other players to come.
[886.36s -> 894.36s]  Otherwise they will have to go into if it does continue into isolation until the cricket will cut can be held so.
[894.36s -> 914.36s]  What we have seen particularly for other parts of the sector is that events have been more postponed for why part and for the wider why cut a region rather than completely cancelled and not returning so there is some positivity for us as we do see this is the lead sector to enter recovery economically and socially for the district.
[914.36s -> 924.36s]  Next slide Sam.
[924.36s -> 942.36s]  We have a three tiered response plan obviously this is no similar to everyone else right now we have a mitigate process with the currently and now we then have a restart phase and then we have a reimagined phase so initially in the response phase no different everyone else lots of briefings.
[942.36s -> 960.36s]  A lot of support we're obviously having face to face briefings across all the sector long before the shutdown and now we've moved to the virtual space we're still doing advocacy at a national level to try and make sure we can access more business support for the region some of the gap right now at a government support and out of the support that to walk I can provide.
[960.36s -> 984.36s]  There's a dozen cover any employees for a hundred employees plus now so that's quite that's quite the pointy end of town we call it for most of our region for our big employers again wage subsidy okay but outside of that there's actually no large industry supports we've been pushing that through government to try and unlock some of that if this can lock down continues we've been doing one of one operated chickens we have 240 listed operators with us.
[984.36s -> 1013.36s]  So again these are daily to weekly chickens by all our teams to make sure we want to be able to access business advice and some of the wage support we've been doing webinars and we've now moved in the last two weeks into workforce redeployment so again we've been taking some organizations or employers that have maybe at least five to ten staff members displaced through to Hoverton who had one of the largest that are around 270 and actually redeploying them and offering them redeployment options into the queue for the industry.
[1014.36s -> 1042.36s]  We placed a hundred and ten staff into Kiwi Fruit with transport from Hoverton as well as the avocado industry which will be the next seasonal workforce will be will be standing up until the end of the year but put staff into supermarkets civil defense security and also they've been providing some services from home but again what we are going to see over the next two weeks we're starting to measure that is the full impact so people that we cannot redeploy that potentially will be out of work.
[1042.36s -> 1052.36s]  So if there's currently a survey underway and will be updating all councils and the government around the overall impact for tourism and white cuts.
[1053.36s -> 1079.36s]  Under the restart phase so again we want to congratulate local government because obviously I'm getting some of those shovel-ready projects through with the Crown Infrastructure Partners for their consideration is a great one for the region but potentially for the sector and pretty much every district has put up around one to two tourism projects as part of shovel-ready so again we do need to focus on the future and how we will restart the region.
[1079.36s -> 1085.36s]  Research we were already in market and about to finish up our domestic perceptions in major research.
[1085.36s -> 1096.36s]  This is now becoming quite timely for us and will help us inform around how we will try and bring back the domestic travelers into the region based on some of the research we've undertaken.
[1097.36s -> 1113.36s]  We're also working on a major in business events restart campaign so that planning has been underway for a couple of weeks so that when we're ready to go we can push go on that we do see events and business events and corporate travel as being the kickstarter we need for economic and social recovery across the region.
[1113.36s -> 1119.36s]  New developments again you've all got new developments going on potentially in your regions.
[1119.36s -> 1129.36s]  We've been in Lake obviously one of your newest hotels in Cambridge and you opened on Christmas Eve so Glenda and the team we've been keeping in touch with quite a lot because they haven't been in operation very long.
[1129.36s -> 1139.36s]  Their impacts are quite severe so again making sure that we still have some future developments that will continue across the region to take us through the next stage.
[1139.36s -> 1149.36s]  Data and insights I've touched on the now going to weekly so again we're sharing that information and to Walker and now we're contributing to the to Walker economic outlook as well which is great.
[1149.36s -> 1160.36s]  And then lastly the mighty local campaign was launched two weeks ago and that's definitely around the restart phase things seem.
[1160.36s -> 1177.36s]  So mighty local again is a partnership with ourselves to Walker all the chambers of commerce so to move to and obviously Cambridge Chamber of Commerce plus the white couple Chamber of Commerce all our councils and the business associations that also exist in some communities and all our regional ice sites.
[1177.36s -> 1188.36s]  We're in phase one so for the last two weeks we've been promoting businesses with contact list delivery promoting you know on people that are still doing entertainment online or virtually from within wire cuts all.
[1188.36s -> 1206.36s]  Recipes from our beloved chefs well being and fitness and this week we launched business stories so again we're starting to use this platform to promote some of the businesses and how they're pivoting into obviously response all looking at different opportunities for their business so the idea is to try and give people hope during phase one.
[1206.36s -> 1215.36s]  During phase two which is obviously from alert level three we will increase our takeaway and even be listings and also essential services are starting to grow as well.
[1215.36s -> 1230.36s]  In phase two we will move more to a local phase at the moment it's a regional platform but the idea is potentially people were able to we're able to group the types of information and services available at a local delivery level and a district level as well.
[1230.36s -> 1259.36s]  And then phase three which has been hopefully all travel restrictions are lifted we will then activate the basically the buy local eat local event local shop visit and explore within the region and obviously that's in partnership with many communities in business associations that already have local programs such as Cambridge with their totally locally Cambridge campaign so we're working with Kelly and the team around how we would try and push via program rather than this one once we get to phase three.
[1260.36s -> 1283.36s]  And when it comes to how we will actually respond long term so at the moment we're in phase one so we're calling it the hyper local phase so one to three months we'll be pushing basically localism everything to do with obviously how you purchase and interact with your local community.
[1283.36s -> 1302.36s]  At phase two which then we'll move into a three to six month bracket we're estimating we can then start to do intra regional travel so we're targeting the drive market within the white hospital region where we hopefully starting to stand up community events again that can happen at a local level in regional business meetings might be able to begin again with social distancing.
[1303.36s -> 1312.36s]  At level three which is what we're planning our scenarios for six to 12 months we can then stand up the domestic market that is when potentially we will mainly focus on drive so.
[1313.36s -> 1331.36s]  As you've heard me say before 2.5 potentially three million people live within three hours radius of the white hospital region including the region itself so we'll definitely be focusing on the drive market national events will be returning as well as national meetings and then eventually corporate travel which again.
[1331.36s -> 1356.36s]  Business are quite a good lead for us with regards to stand up the sector again and then lastly we're planning on one to two years before we actually start to see any sort of international impact again short haul markets into Australia and the Pacific will open first and then we will eventually move back into major events international conferences and starting to bring back the corporate and leisure travel market into white hospital so.
[1356.36s -> 1366.36s]  That's the timeframe we are currently doing our scenario planning for but as we all know it may change every week based on the levels we have.
[1373.36s -> 1385.36s]  And then lastly reimagined so you would have seen that last week or actually two weeks ago as well the government announced that there was a call to reshape and reimagined the tourism industry so we have been pushing for the last two to three months.
[1386.36s -> 1405.36s]  With tourism New Zealand and the Minister for tourism around what we're calling a reimagining of tourism when we now is our chance that this is more than a shock it's actually a bit of a circuit breaker for the sector and for all business sectors for us all to look and see how could we do our businesses differently we all knew that tourism was growing in quite an exponential rate.
[1405.36s -> 1433.36s]  And there were some areas that were really feeling the pressure such as Queenstown and central Otago and Cathedral cove some of our sites Mount Tomoruto so for us now it's great to see the government are taking this seriously so we're now working with tourism New Zealand to lead a new plan domestically and internationally but also look at all these types of questions you know where our previous visit arrivals and expenditure growth right for the region what will success look like for us for the future for a visitor market.
[1433.36s -> 1461.36s]  How do we move our sector from boom and bust again no different to the food and fiber sector or any other business cycle and lastly how do we move to more sustainable community lead tourism and for us on the way cuts of what we call creating net benefit rather than just benefiting those that potentially we're making money out of tourism we want to see communities thrive and that they have the decision around what sort of tourism they want so again we will be moving our 2016 tourism opportunities plan which many of you were involved in.
[1461.36s -> 1489.36s]  We will now be developing a destination management plan and that will be happening nationally as well to try and what we call transform tourism for the better so there is no such word as recovery now we will not be receiving the same sorts of level of tourism as we did previously but neither we might not have the same sort of services and opportunities available in tourism as well post COVID so again it is a good opportunity for us to look at transform in the sector.
[1490.36s -> 1506.36s]  I think same I think we got one more looking lastly just obviously a call I call it to all my love government partners I really appreciate everyone helping to promote your rates relief emissions and installment policies not just for the tourism sector but for all business.
[1506.36s -> 1519.36s]  I think it's great to see you all continue with your resource consent process maybe in a more delayed way but again the liquor and food licensing is going to be more important for us particularly when we try and stand up after level three.
[1519.36s -> 1535.36s]  We still have the regional major event strategy activation so again we are still awaiting some decision from well energy trust about potentially helping to establish a regional major events fund which will actually assist all the districts to be able to bid for major events again.
[1535.36s -> 1561.36s]  And also to attract and build new major events into our shoulders season across the region and then lastly again just to thank you all for your continual funding to support the tourism industry and that would obviously be more important through restart and the reimagined phase and again the point I made earlier we will not be recovering to pre COVID levels for at least two to five years as a sector and as a region.
[1562.36s -> 1565.36s]  That's pretty much it from me.
[1565.36s -> 1568.36s]  So maybe to take any questions.
[1568.36s -> 1579.36s]  Thanks Jason that's a I've got to say that's a fantastic response to what must have been a massive shock to the industry.
[1579.36s -> 1606.36s]  Yeah and of course in white power and probably a lot of white cattle as well domestic tourism sexually a lot bigger than international so we really want to see and as you have in your plan that being that being worked on as soon as it's soon as it becomes a possibility but yeah does anyone have questions just put your hands up I can see you all clear.
[1606.36s -> 1616.36s]  Okay yeah thanks a lot Jason and yeah fantastic if and I think being put in by all your team you know in this situation.
[1616.36s -> 1629.36s]  A couple of questions well the first one was that I noticed that in the regional major event strategy there's a new funding partner mentioned is that the well energy relationship or is it all right.
[1629.36s -> 1631.36s]  Great you said as well energy.
[1631.36s -> 1640.36s]  That's great and the other thing is for your reimagining you know the future of tourism I saw that you had your stakeholders listed.
[1640.36s -> 1649.36s]  I didn't see the department of conservation there not that they are a tourism operator but most of our you know popular destinations.
[1649.36s -> 1673.36s]  Yeah I think a cathedral cove you know they're actually managed by the department and and I just wonder if it would be worthwhile trying to get them sort of around the table so that because I hear that you know they worry about the pressure points that we were experiencing and that you know just having their input you know might be beneficial.
[1673.36s -> 1681.36s]  So look absolutely so you're sorry about that clear the department of conservation are part of that so it's actually a joint tourism New Zealand and doc.
[1681.36s -> 1694.36s]  Review of tourism and it's only because they they both actually contributed to the national tourism out there all strategies so they're definitely part of it we don't obviously have a lot of any national parts but we do still have a lot of crown estate.
[1694.36s -> 1719.36s]  In some of the crown estate in our region are obviously some of our waterfalls and lake areas so again and along our rivers we just they will be engaging in that as well because we did obviously have some opportunities with doc originally before covered sort of developing short walks for the region under the great walks mental so that's some projects that we now have brought forward again to say can we'll dock reconsider moving some of this for the domestic market.
[1719.36s -> 1722.36s]  That sounds fantastic you're welcome.
[1724.36s -> 1727.36s]  We have any other questions Liz.
[1727.36s -> 1731.36s]  Yeah I guess it's just a huge thank you Jason to the support you have.
[1731.36s -> 1741.36s]  Operators you know I've been affected a little myself and the calls that I get from your Tina are a very encouraging it's very that's very certain.
[1741.36s -> 1751.36s]  Just one of the things I just wanted to check in with you on and that's we do have a presentation a little bit later among the township and I see you've also given me some support and that's really great.
[1751.36s -> 1768.36s]  Who are aligned on a lot of the international visitors and I guess it's lucky for us in some ways that there's not that many why power operators that are aligned on international among a township is probably one of them perhaps our eyesight to a certain degree and servicing international guests.
[1768.36s -> 1778.36s]  But other than that do you think that there are any other aspects of why power that are going to be greatly affected with international because it's really where the biggest you know issues are going to be.
[1778.36s -> 1783.36s]  It's mainly going to be the sports sports coach so I think if we can try and get.
[1783.36s -> 1791.36s]  Some of the international sporting events back up and running as soon as possible to pending on travel restrictions they would be the main impact for why power.
[1791.36s -> 1794.36s]  But you are correct look pretty much most of our events which are great.
[1794.36s -> 1801.36s]  And our operators pretty much talk to the domestic market and I still feel that again look the why country expressway.
[1801.36s -> 1804.36s]  But the other work that potentially has been put forward for shovel ready.
[1804.36s -> 1812.36s]  Even extending expressway down to PID that that's just all going to help the ease of domestic travel and we definitely see the push from self drive.
[1812.36s -> 1825.36s]  Obviously the motorhome and caravan association they are going to be another first leader and move her back into the region as well, which is fantastic so we're working with them and a traveler around trying to get more people back into why power.
[1825.36s -> 1840.36s]  I think again your geographic location your natural environment and also your event platforms hold you in a stronger position around obviously recovering compared to other parts of our region.
[1841.36s -> 1848.36s]  Okay, thanks very much for that you've done an awful lot of work and you've got a lot more in front of you I can see.
[1848.36s -> 1856.36s]  But that's great and if we've got no more queries I'll we have a recommendation do we have a mover please.
[1856.36s -> 1861.36s]  Thanks Marcus thanks clear all in favor please say aye.
[1862.36s -> 1871.36s]  Country no carried thanks very much Jason all the best thank you are relying on you thank you and thanks Sam good work.
[1871.36s -> 1886.36s]  Yes I see we have Mark sorry Mark Morgan with us yet and also Kelvin and Andrew there we'll get to you guys before long.
[1887.36s -> 1901.36s]  But Mark from CEO Hamilton Airport yeah the floor of yours and just like Jason on you've had a massive change to your business so yeah.
[1901.36s -> 1904.36s]  Let's see how you're going on.
[1904.36s -> 1911.36s]  Thanks Andrew and thanks for the opportunity welcome to all of the elected members.
[1911.36s -> 1916.36s]  Hopefully we've got a presentation coming up and that should be before you now.
[1916.36s -> 1922.36s]  Look today I've also got Scott Kendall my finance manager.
[1922.36s -> 1931.36s]  So Scott will deal with a couple of the finance slides and as most of what we have to talk you about is in the rules of finance.
[1932.36s -> 1947.36s]  Perhaps not quite the presentation I had intended to present a month ago but as we know a lot has changed and a massive amount has changed for route in the in the last three or four weeks.
[1948.36s -> 1967.36s]  So the presentation is is primarily and if we can stand move to the next slide is primarily around the COVID-19 response for our but I thought it was about eight or nine slides to key slides to take you through.
[1968.36s -> 1986.36s]  And I think what you'll see is how we built with the crisis what the implications have been for the group now and for the next 15 months and a summary that shared some some positive light at the end of the tunnel.
[1986.36s -> 1990.36s]  Thanks Sam if we move on.
[1990.36s -> 1998.36s]  The first point I think is useful to you've obviously received our six month interim results.
[1998.36s -> 2004.36s]  Some say you're only as good as your last results but sadly that's not the not quite the case today.
[2004.36s -> 2018.36s]  But look we were traveling extremely well very very good first six months and in fact on target for a record financial performance under any measure of our SRI for this this financial year.
[2018.36s -> 2043.36s]  But of course the net lead to our draft SRI that you've also received and that of course is now pretty much irrelevant and I see that you ironically have an appendix letter to my chair Barry Harris about about OSRI and as you can imagine we are working very quickly towards a revised SRI for the next three years.
[2044.36s -> 2050.36s]  Particularly the financials but also there'll be some narrative change and some priority changing as well.
[2050.36s -> 2063.36s]  We have as a say completed a very detailed 15 month forecast through the 30 June next year that will form of course now part of the year one of the of the SRI.
[2063.36s -> 2080.36s]  We have a presentation the rail board and myself has a presentation to all share holding councils in May and we by that stage will have finalized the new drafts.
[2080.36s -> 2088.36s]  So moving sorry moving on to the next slide.
[2088.36s -> 2104.36s]  I think now just looking at the impact and look very difficult to well it's very easy to explain in simple terms it's had a massive impact on the business but if I divided into these four areas that are before you.
[2104.36s -> 2133.36s]  So of course the first is the aeronautical business in New Zealand complete as you know suspension of flights so for us that was an immediate loss of income really from April but from the last week of March and along with our general aviation all three Harris the flight school basically you know 97 98% loss of our aeronautical income overnight.
[2133.36s -> 2155.36s]  Terminal close and we really operating as an emergency medical service only at the airport had the same impact on our on our property but in fact our property is our lifeline that I will come to but again really overnight impact on our tendencies we're quite a large landlord as you know and
[2155.36s -> 2173.36s]  but to date and Scott will talk a wee bit about this but to date we've had good support from our tenants but we're early days as we know into the next sort of three to six months as businesses work through how they're going to operate and survive during this process.
[2173.36s -> 2193.36s]  We've obviously suspended the terminal upgrade work and I'll talk to that a bit further on which of course was a major piece of work approximately 15 million dollars of of proposed work a hotel has been sorry if we can just go back to the previous slide Sam the hotel.
[2193.36s -> 2210.36s]  Impacted significantly as well fortunately during April we have it was taken over by Ministry of Health as a isolation facility it wasn't required it was a backup to the Auckland hotels.
[2210.36s -> 2224.36s]  Nonetheless we have received and we are receiving payment for the use of the hotel by the government but that ends really this week and from then on a difficult times ahead and we'll talk about that.
[2224.36s -> 2250.36s]  And obviously our people all my team are working remotely that's working very very well my sort of 11 or 12 on our immediate COVID team response but of course the cafe and store staff are at home unable to work and part of the government subsidy risk you 14 does remain on site at this point.
[2250.36s -> 2258.36s]  So that's really been the impact what have we really tried to do about if we could move to the next slide.
[2258.36s -> 2281.36s]  First of all we we very quickly leading into probably two weeks before we moved into level two and level three of before we even knew what that meant we had worked very closely with the board around a pandemic plan how we would operate the business and more importantly started to look at some scenario and modeling at that point.
[2281.36s -> 2295.36s]  Jason would have mentioned earlier on as board is such as China we're we're closing to tourism we also saw the writing on the ward on the wall for our own business.
[2295.36s -> 2324.36s]  So that plan was developed and approved by the board before we even went into lockdown we've completed second cost reductions in the business that's right across the business of its major cost reductions in our expense lines reductions pretty much across our business in terms of payroll anything up to a 20% reduction and the board have also taken a reduction in their director fees.
[2324.36s -> 2351.36s]  So we applied for and received the government wage subsidy across the group and with the hotel we worked through and are still working through with jet park but they've gone through a full restructuring exercise number of people have been made redundant and number have been retained under the government subsidy but we have a meeting later this week with jet park to look at stage two.
[2351.36s -> 2369.36s]  People Association that we're part of is doing a major piece of work with central government to try and see what support of any there are for airport companies that have been significantly picked as you know we are we are long term infrastructure owners and
[2369.36s -> 2379.36s]  quite significant capital to maintain the assets so there's a piece of work going on in that space.
[2379.36s -> 2385.36s]  Already covered the people we can move to the next slide.
[2385.36s -> 2414.36s]  The scenario modelling that I talk about there I think the point that I will that I will make here and come back to the end is that most airport companies particularly regionally airport companies are significantly hit and hit now we are fortunate that we made the decision five or six years ago that the board.
[2414.36s -> 2443.36s]  The leadership of John Spencer and then implemented by myself and my team with we have as you know di this by the airport company and that is I guess bought us time so we have completed a very conservative model for argument sake it assumes no in New Zealand activity of any of any meaningful sense before October this year.
[2443.36s -> 2460.36s]  No and then only a recovery of about 40% of passenger numbers through 2021 calendar year and well into 2022 before we have a positive event that really so what is.
[2460.36s -> 2481.36s]  And we've also taken a very conservative view of our leases of our leases ability to pass etc no activity out of the hotel really for the balance of this calendar year so very very conservative but realistic modelling.
[2481.36s -> 2504.36s]  Fortunately we have a major land sale that is unconditional and very extremely good family significant family multinational business that have agreed to further provide a letter of credit to the airport company which gives me confidence to to build the road so to speak so.
[2504.36s -> 2528.36s]  That delivers about two and a half million dollars of of margin of free cash flow into the group early next year so the reality is that we can get through this year and through the June 21 almost a slightly positive cash position the balance sheets taken a bit of a hit and Scott will take you through that but.
[2528.36s -> 2544.36s]  And also we have some work going on on central precinct and again we have the ability hopefully to settle some unconditional land sales with the same degree of confidence around further charities which will also feed some additional cash into the group.
[2545.36s -> 2561.36s]  We've only utilised about 65% of our of our debt funding and in fact we have further facilities that we were intending to take any way pre COVID and we will still take which will take our funding up to about 30 million.
[2561.36s -> 2589.36s]  And then we will have only utilised not much more than 50% of that by June next year so most of the cash burn is funded out of out of our overdraft during this period and then the land sales kick back in and we're back in positive space being said very supportive and no issues there around funding.
[2590.36s -> 2592.36s]  Next slide please.
[2594.36s -> 2611.36s]  So we have joined with Hamilton City and and I have spoken to Gary diet and others around the obviously the crown infrastructure projects we have put forward two applications if you've had a chance to to review.
[2612.36s -> 2631.36s]  The submission she would be aware there are 23 projects we have submitted for the terminal redevelopment and also for an amalgam of a number of projects around the airport that deal with roading lateral infrastructure, our wastewater plant.
[2631.36s -> 2660.36s]  And various other aspect that again is also worth about 11 million dollars so we have put those in whether we're successful who knows that under the terminal redevelopment project we're ready to go tenders have been received and being evaluated the week of lockdown our consent is in with what and with your council at the moment and that's well there was well underway.
[2661.36s -> 2671.36s]  We project we could be out of the ground and doing enabling works within a month of a funding line.
[2671.36s -> 2682.36s]  The key for myself and the board will be what are the tags that the government apply if we are successful to the funding mechanism how much of it is.
[2682.36s -> 2692.36s]  The loan is a grant etc that's underway and that's part of our recovery program so if we go to the next slide.
[2693.36s -> 2710.36s]  It's been important as we work through really the devastation of the past three or four weeks to make sure that we still keep our eye on the longer term for the group and our focus over the next 12 months.
[2710.36s -> 2723.36s]  I won't spend any detailed time here other than to let you know that we have a clear set of a clear business plan and a clear set of objectives for FY 21.
[2723.36s -> 2744.36s]  Most of those remain in place we are reviewing them currently as a management team but we are trying to make sure that we continue property is a major contributor and as you can see there potentially to shy 8 million dollars in land sales in this next 12 month period.
[2745.36s -> 2765.36s]  Operations we continue to maintain the runway fortunately in our 10 year asset management plan we have a very quiet we just spent close to a million dollars finishing in March of this year on some apron works and some pumps some other bits and pieces.
[2765.36s -> 2780.36s]  But we have a very quiet couple of expenditure for error nautical over the next 12 to 18 months which couldn't have come at a better time but we maintain the assets and you need to know that we that we will.
[2780.36s -> 2794.36s]  When it comes to we'll be working very closely with the New Zealand to try and obviously kickstart services again and so our whole marketing and social media and common strategy.
[2794.36s -> 2823.36s]  The common strategy will be around exactly that a hotel is a much more difficult beast as you would have gained from Jason's presentation but look we we are working now closely with jet park to understand what a what a plan coming out the other side may look like fortunately it's a hotel that wasn't reliant on international tourism but it is reliant.
[2823.36s -> 2852.36s]  So that is reliant on conferencing in particular and we yet to understand the behavior of the business community as we go forward in this new world so we have just almost spending close to 4 million on the hotel just prior to lockdown so it is it's a it's a property that we're going to have to maintain in the meantime and fund.
[2852.36s -> 2867.36s]  And our conservative modeling does does mean that the group can fund its interests in the hotel semi for the next 18 months with limited activity from it.
[2867.36s -> 2896.36s]  And if we move now into the next slide which is probably the financial certain couple of slides here on on sort of financials and all its scots leading now my our overarching comment here would be you had a lot of detail in the six month interim results so we decided there was no point in replicating information you will have read so Scott will summarize it here and more importantly take you out the other side over the next couple of years.
[2896.36s -> 2924.36s]  Alright good afternoon everyone and thanks Matt for the introduction yeah I went to I'll too much on the past because it's unfortunately to become largely irrelevant but I guess just some key takeaways from the slide and what you may have read already an interim report but it's really that they maintain we've built the past couple of years around a sustainable so recurring revenue based through passenger growth in the airport business through a property portfolio that it continued really well for the first half of the year.
[2924.36s -> 2930.36s]  And go obviously without covered 19 we speak to continue to the full year and beyond.
[2930.36s -> 2943.36s]  Yeah just some points from properly obviously talking some big numbers around land sales I guess that they are land sales that have been contemplated under a 10 year plan the land sales and the pipeline it's not something that we've done.
[2943.36s -> 2971.36s]  New York reaction or sort of a fire sale type arrangement just to get some cash for the next couple years these are the land we're selling is sort of surplus to your normal requirements in fact much of it's actually physically separate from the airport through a gully system so we're not compromising any core assets sort of future capability by selling this land very much is land it's service the airport so it's why it's being sold off time it has been.
[2971.36s -> 2980.36s]  Yeah just with the hotel obviously it is a new investment for us a new industry invested in really pleased with the early trading performance.
[2980.36s -> 2994.36s]  Yeah and probably pleasing that we didn't other than the initial money to do the property up the tenders and deferred maintenance and things it's actually traded cash flow positive has no it's been profitable with appreciation and things but.
[2994.36s -> 3020.36s]  That we're actually able to repay some debt and you know that it's the early vital signs and occupancy and room rate have been been certainly in lump expectation and again kind of right up until February March it was really just coming to a stride around the conference center and the food beverage offerings so yeah I think you know it was you know it was looking really positive and hopefully on the other side that's your momentum we can we can leverage off again so.
[3020.36s -> 3025.36s]  Probably just look look to the future now just move to the next slide.
[3025.36s -> 3039.36s]  Please so given here just sort of in six month increments the remainder of the financial year also the financial year that we're in and then the following three that are presented in the draft statement of a ten year received.
[3039.36s -> 3049.36s]  I think important to focus on a bit because that sort of cash flow metric for us that includes land sales but it excludes of course costs like depreciation which.
[3049.36s -> 3070.36s]  It's around three million dollars a year for us which in the short term it's not necessarily linear with the investment we make into assets so seeing obviously seeing a reasonably significant decline in the next in this calendar year with across the business certainly going to suffer.
[3070.36s -> 3082.36s]  So as we see in the sort of early six months between December 20 and June next year that's effective this large land sale taking effect and then as the business kind of gets back on its feet.
[3082.36s -> 3091.36s]  You can see it's slowly back to cash flow positive so I guess you want to compare the red the red in the blue the blue bars and red line and the green line is sort of where we're going to head now.
[3091.36s -> 3098.36s]  You can see it differently the next sort of 15 to 18 months is going to be a bit painful but after that.
[3098.36s -> 3115.36s]  Very much back on our feet and not becoming heavily reliant on land sales certainly out past the next 18 months so we've only seen what's already under contract and what some condition will settle in those numbers so I think that's the conservative but realistic and conservative on both fronts.
[3116.36s -> 3127.36s]  Certainly the cost we're looking to remove out of the business and anything that's going to compromise us long term we're not giving out capability but either we've built or we've managed to hang onto it for as long as we have.
[3127.36s -> 3144.36s]  I think it's some yeah definitely conservative and look at things don't play out the way we see them doing and certainly not as positive as what I did is some opportunities if further but but now it's this sort of as realistic that we can preserve our current capability anyway.
[3144.36s -> 3158.36s]  Yeah I guess just overlay the net profit slide yeah there's a lot more probably that the difference it's a bigger largely because of the effect of depreciation but ultimately following a fairly similar trend to the cash flow that's.
[3158.36s -> 3170.36s]  Look land sales over the next 18 months will get us cash flow positive and we expect by the end of the business to be largely cash flow positive from it's recurring trading to be sustainable.
[3170.36s -> 3195.36s]  And yeah that's probably I guess the main takeaway there and it's not really built into the slides but just it's not talked about the fact on the balance sheet look we expect that there will be some impact so a balance sheet round property values most of the equity movements so it was a shareholder that obviously will impact your accounts as well but I guess out of this is a shareholder in a non financial sense.
[3195.36s -> 3208.36s]  Out of all this we're preserving our capability and we're not compromising any about your notical capability and I think yeah in terms of what the service will keep delivering that shouldn't be compromised or at least our ability to tell it.
[3208.36s -> 3214.36s]  That was really well I had just the other financials so it might be perfect to wrap up.
[3214.36s -> 3237.36s]  I think this is the last slide my apologies we've taken a bit of your time but look I think the key themes here really as I opened up we we we hit this situation in a very strong position and in a very strong balance sheet a record here.
[3237.36s -> 3261.36s]  The full side of the diversification through our 10 year group strategy has I think really bought this company time perhaps unlike some other regional airports that I think will need to go to their shareholders very quickly for additional funding or through their through their bank funding lines we don't need to
[3261.36s -> 3286.36s]  that non revenue has been absolutely critical to and in fact ironically we never predicted a COVID 19 scenario but we did predict a loss of aeronautical income through cessation of services or reduced services so has been one of the same.
[3286.36s -> 3312.36s]  Overall the recovery as Scott has mentioned will be modest but sustainable and as I want to keep restating we won't need to go to our core debt at this stage or funding lines to fund this we can fund it out of the effect the working capital.
[3312.36s -> 3339.36s]  And most importantly I think for you as the shareholders there is no requirement for the board to come to it shareholders for support and we don't see a scenario at all that that requires the shareholders to assist the airport company in the foreseeable future so that's it from me sorry and I apologize we're over time but happy to take questions if you've got time.
[3339.36s -> 3358.36s]  No thanks guys I think we were aware that a bit of extra time was going to be required for you guys with such a massive impact I just got a quick question about the flight school when would they not get back to level one or possibly could be operated level two.
[3358.36s -> 3387.36s]  Well in fact Scotts just had some advice today could will be that the pilots that that are well through their qualification will be able to start flying under level three so as soon as next week we could see some flight activity but it will be to your point Andrew down at level one probably will be the social distancing issues when you have an instructor and a trainee pilot on board so I think we're still around clear and so are all three.
[3388.36s -> 3410.36s]  I think it's worth noting that we don't quite know where we're going to go with L3 in the sense that they've got 180 pilots currently at the airport in Hamilton or out of the accommodation at the airport.
[3410.36s -> 3439.36s]  They will find they're fine for the next few months for question is how whether they're going to be the logistics of moving pilots across borders for training and actually pilots there is not a death of pilots in the global marketplace as a result of the catastrophe for the airlines so I think those two would suggest to us that we've got difficult times ahead past the end of 2020 with L3.
[3439.36s -> 3466.36s]  Yeah that makes sense yeah I think it's as you've both noted the stage that you're at with your property development has been a very fortunate thing if this had occurred at the beginning of that it would have been far more financially destructive but does anyone else have any queries
[3467.36s -> 3484.36s]  Okay that's not in case luck thank you very much a really comprehensive update and great to see you recovered from the shock and being really positive and constructive going forward so thanks very much to you both.
[3484.36s -> 3487.36s]  Thank you.
[3487.36s -> 3488.36s]  Thank you.
[3488.36s -> 3494.36s]  And I see we have Kelvin.
[3494.36s -> 3498.36s]  Sorry what was that.
[3498.36s -> 3502.36s]  Okay so we got Kelvin and also is Peter available.
[3502.36s -> 3503.36s]  Yes I am.
[3503.36s -> 3514.36s]  Oh great so thanks Kelvin and Peter and will let you get on to the shared services.
[3514.36s -> 3527.36s]  Thanks Mr Chairman and thanks for the opportunity to speak with you this afternoon you've been provided with a copy of the company statement of intent and half yearly report to 31 December 2019.
[3527.36s -> 3543.36s]  I'm conscious of the fact this is the first opportunity I've had as the newest chair of the last to talk to you so I wanted to start by just briefly introducing myself and then I wanted to talk a little bit about the company's transformation role.
[3543.36s -> 3566.36s]  How are we going to do things differently what it means for your council and then I want to conclude with some remarks about COVID-19 but I guess the key point is that certainly from the board of last is perspective the organisation has never been more relevant than it will be in a post COVID-19 recovery period.
[3566.36s -> 3579.36s]  So the first point I wanted to make is that my family has been heavily invested in the Waikato for a very long time my mother's family came to this region in 1865.
[3579.36s -> 3591.36s]  My father's family came to this region in 1880s and all my family live in the region my mum lives in Hauraki district my sister lives in terms Coromandel I have another system in Hamilton.
[3591.36s -> 3608.36s]  I live in Auckland district and after 44 years and Janaya leaving Auckland next week and moving to Cambridge so we very much look forward to becoming why by district council rate piers us from first of May.
[3608.36s -> 3615.36s]  So as you can see my family's been heavily invested in the success of the region and it's one of the reasons I took the job.
[3615.36s -> 3626.36s]  Another reason is the clarity of the opportunity and I've spent 21 years in local government governance across multiple CCOs and clarity of role is actually quite unusual.
[3626.36s -> 3643.36s]  In this case the company's vision is to have Waikato councils working together in the best way possible for the collective benefit of their man their communities which means less burden on rate piers happier communities and council staff and more effective councils.
[3643.36s -> 3650.36s]  So as we've set out in our statement of intent the organization really exists to do three things.
[3650.36s -> 3665.36s]  First of all to create effectiveness and efficiency gains for shareholders such as you secondly to help increase the influence of the region and thirdly to help shareholders provide a better customer experience.
[3665.36s -> 3678.36s]  What less does is provide an opportunity to think regionally without boundaries and to then help councils use that thing locally to improve the well being of the community.
[3678.36s -> 3694.36s]  So thinking regionally means that rather than individual councils trying to solve their problems individually less can help them work them out with the cost of that spread while still allowing local choices to whether to implement solutions locally.
[3695.36s -> 3711.36s]  I think that it's fair to say my observation would be that over the years of its existence the organization's done a good job but I think one of the reasons that I've been hired is that there was an opportunity seen to be able to really grasp the company's potential.
[3711.36s -> 3717.36s]  So when I was hired the board said that it wanted to undertake a number of transformative projects at place.
[3717.36s -> 3725.36s]  And for that reason we are going to and are driving the organization harder and faster.
[3725.36s -> 3739.36s]  And earlier this year the board committed to do just that we are looking to be bolder more disruptive to enable you to help you transform how you and other Waikato councils operate.
[3739.36s -> 3749.36s]  We also won't be afraid of failing and by that I mean recognizing the opportunities worth pursuing as long as we do it fast.
[3749.36s -> 3759.36s]  Coming from the private sector having spent 35 years in the private sector my observation would be that there's nothing wrong with failure so long as you fail fast and fail cheap.
[3759.36s -> 3767.36s]  So within that in mind and looking ahead over the next 18 months there are really three core elements to what we're doing.
[3767.36s -> 3775.36s]  There are some key strategic projects which we'll be looking to advance as fast as possible and you'll see those projects in the statement of intent.
[3775.36s -> 3788.36s]  There are some businesses usual projects and in addition I've asked for a re examination of some of the work that we're doing to see whether we should stop doing it.
[3788.36s -> 3796.36s]  As you'll appreciate it's it's really fundamental to perceptions of success of an organization that they seem to be making progress month by month.
[3796.36s -> 3809.36s]  So one of the things we've done is introduced a lot more careful tracking about what it is that we're doing and whether we're being successful and we're looking to improve the communications to key council staff as well.
[3809.36s -> 3821.36s]  I said to my board colleagues and you'll be aware I'm sure that the that everyone sits around the last board with the exception of me is a chief executive of one of the member councils.
[3821.36s -> 3826.36s]  I've said to my board colleagues that they are really the difference between less succeeding and failing that.
[3826.36s -> 3834.36s]  And the reason for that is that they are the ones who will dictate the resourcing and prioritization and cooperation, which is according to less projects.
[3834.36s -> 3846.36s]  And I made the point pretty clearly that without their total commitment, the organization will fail, but equally their success lesser success will be their success and vice versa.
[3846.36s -> 3852.36s]  And now to what it means for your council think three things.
[3852.36s -> 3864.36s]  First of all, you should consider this organization as an extension of your vision of building the future together to promote the well being of why part district and its people.
[3864.36s -> 3871.36s]  We both got a role to play in providing solutions to the high growth region of the wake up tour.
[3871.36s -> 3877.36s]  We both recognize the need to do more with less to drive cost out of local councils.
[3877.36s -> 3889.36s]  We both want to ensure that nationally the wake up tour region punches above its weight by showing that the region can provide can provide joined up services across the region.
[3889.36s -> 3893.36s]  We both want to improve the well bearing of the community.
[3893.36s -> 3896.36s]  Indeed, it's in your vision.
[3896.36s -> 3900.36s]  Secondly, as an organization, as I've said before, we're not limited by boundaries.
[3900.36s -> 3905.36s]  We're tasked with thinking regionally to enable you to act better locally.
[3905.36s -> 3917.36s]  And I think the opportunities to work with you and your companion councils to achieve your aspirations are boundless regardless and possibly even more because of COVID-19.
[3917.36s -> 3922.36s]  Thirdly, obviously by necessity, we need resource to achieve our outcomes.
[3922.36s -> 3933.36s]  And you'll see that some of the initiatives that we've proposed in the statement of intent will require some upfront investment in order to achieve some mid to long term savings.
[3933.36s -> 3936.36s]  Now, I said I would finish with a few words on coronavirus.
[3936.36s -> 3946.36s]  It won't surprise you to know that as a board, we've discussed very early on whether we should make any substantive changes to our work program to reflect what will be a new reality.
[3947.36s -> 3955.36s]  What we concluded, indeed, was that in fact, we should keep doing what we're doing because it's going to be even more important.
[3955.36s -> 3960.36s]  Moreover, it's going to help rebuild the region and increase resilience.
[3960.36s -> 3968.36s]  Our view is that in a post COVID-19 period during the recovery period, there'll be need in the region for at least the following three things.
[3968.36s -> 3980.36s]  First, security of public works to enable the private sector to plan long range, and I think importantly commit to training and for their staff to commit the stay in the region.
[3980.36s -> 3990.36s]  Secondly, a demonstration of restraint by public bodies on what might be perceived as non-essential spending, in other words, doing more with less.
[3990.36s -> 3996.36s]  And thirdly, motivation and encouragement and development of current council staff.
[3996.36s -> 4003.36s]  I'm planning to deliver all of those already through our work program has set out on the statement of intend.
[4003.36s -> 4006.36s]  So thank you for the opportunity to talk to you.
[4006.36s -> 4016.36s]  I obviously wish that I could have spoken with you in person, but no doubt that opportunity will arise sometime shortly in the future.
[4016.36s -> 4025.36s]  Kelvin and I are more than happy to take any questions, Mr Chair, but I wondered, Kelvin, if there is any additional points that you wanted to make.
[4026.36s -> 4030.36s]  All right, well covered Peter, thank you.
[4030.36s -> 4033.36s]  Okay, thanks very much for that.
[4033.36s -> 4051.36s]  Yeah, as you mentioned, the less has been active in there, in there, well, between our councils for a number of years now and been very successful, particularly with Rata, the road and accord.
[4052.36s -> 4057.36s]  What's happening now is an absolute step change.
[4057.36s -> 4066.36s]  And I totally agree with what you said about it being more important post COVID rather than less.
[4066.36s -> 4070.36s]  So yeah, I wish we were success of course.
[4070.36s -> 4073.36s]  Now questions, I think.
[4073.36s -> 4075.36s]  Claire, yes.
[4075.36s -> 4078.36s]  Yeah, yeah, thanks Andrew.
[4078.36s -> 4084.36s]  And great to meet you via Zoom, you know, and it's good to see you too, Kelvin.
[4084.36s -> 4091.36s]  I did see through some questions, but I'm two, two, um, ones that I'd just like to ask in this forum.
[4091.36s -> 4101.36s]  The first one is that, you know, you've made a strong case for continuing how you're going at the moment, you know, that all those things that you're focusing on
[4101.36s -> 4107.36s]  will be more important than ever when we're dealing in the post COVID era, I guess.
[4107.36s -> 4120.36s]  But a lot of the things that are done rely on the, I suppose, the goodwill of councils and releasing resources from their business to work on less stuff.
[4120.36s -> 4133.36s]  I can foresee that councils are actually going to be pretty hard pressed with their own, own staffing resources dealing with, you know, extra things that have come out of the woodwork to do with COVID-19.
[4133.36s -> 4146.36s]  And so what assurance can you give us that you won't sort of find yourself high and dry that you can't get the sort of resource that you do need, you know, from the individual councils that have normally been really supportive.
[4146.36s -> 4153.36s]  Because, you know, you start just completely committed, you know, to this other work.
[4153.36s -> 4159.36s]  Kelvin, would you mind if I answered that question first? And then, sure, maybe there's a few additional points you want to make.
[4159.36s -> 4163.36s]  I think Councillor, thank you. That's a great question.
[4163.36s -> 4169.36s]  The good news is we had, I'm happy to say, thought of that as well.
[4169.36s -> 4193.36s]  One of the earliest things that we did well before lockdown was, when we could see this thing coming, was to reach out to councils to ask them to think about whether in the context of any redeployment of assets and people that they were doing, whether they were going to be some people that might in fact be freed up to be able to work on some of our projects to make them go faster.
[4193.36s -> 4206.36s]  And I was pleasantly surprised, particularly from some of the smaller councils to be honest, about the positive response that we got in terms of offering up staff.
[4206.36s -> 4224.36s]  That's the first point. The second point is that more specifically, Kelvin's been in touch with the chief executives of all of the councils, I think, is recently as yesterday, Kelvin, where we've set out some specific skill sets that we're looking for in order to be able to advance some of our strategic projects.
[4224.36s -> 4241.36s]  As I say, a great question. Surprisingly, positive response from the councils that we've reached out to, but you're absolutely right. The resourcing issue may even flow over time and it's something we're acutely conscious of.
[4241.36s -> 4244.36s]  Kelvin, did you have any points to add?
[4244.36s -> 4249.36s]  I think that sort of covers it all off pager, to be honest.
[4249.36s -> 4253.36s]  Well, that's really encouraging actually.
[4253.36s -> 4257.36s]  It's good to get, excuse me, it's good to get that clarification. That's great.
[4257.36s -> 4263.36s]  Now the question I had was about the energy and carbon management that's mentioned in the SIO.
[4263.36s -> 4272.36s]  I wasn't sure whether that is the carbon audit that our council is sort of before the last election.
[4272.36s -> 4283.36s]  That was one of the directions that we gave staff that we wanted to get something organised and that which would help us, I suppose, formulate a plan for climate change and that.
[4283.36s -> 4292.36s]  Is the energy management that's mentioned that that less does? Is that feeding into that audit or not?
[4292.36s -> 4301.36s]  So the shorter answer is Councillor, no, it's well, it's certainly not the audit that you're referring to.
[4301.36s -> 4321.36s]  I don't see any particular reason why the people that we use to, that we engage to provide that support to councils could not help with that audit if that was something that the white part executive team were interested in doing.
[4321.36s -> 4328.36s]  But actually, probably to the particular, the status of the particular piece of work that you're referring to.
[4328.36s -> 4337.36s]  I know that Martin Lunch who's one of the guys that tends to work with white part district council has been doing some.
[4337.36s -> 4345.36s]  The spoke work in this area, but I'm not sure whether it specifically relates to that report that you're referring to.
[4345.36s -> 4351.36s]  Okay, oh well, thanks for the clarification.
[4351.36s -> 4355.36s]  Okay, any more questions?
[4355.36s -> 4359.36s]  No, okay, well, hey, thank you very much for that presentation.
[4359.36s -> 4368.36s]  And yeah, particularly now in a period of significant change, that's really great to see the positivity.
[4368.36s -> 4376.36s]  Going forward even in with the with the weird wheel we have around a certain moment. So yeah, thanks Peter Kelvin very much.
[4376.36s -> 4379.36s]  Thank you very much, Mr Chair.
[4379.36s -> 4387.36s]  And I see Andrew Michael is available and we'll talk to us about the LGFA.
[4387.36s -> 4389.36s]  Thank you for the opportunity.
[4389.36s -> 4397.36s]  Maybe make a few brief comments and then touch on the current environment and then leave some time for full questions.
[4397.36s -> 4408.36s]  So LGFA started in 2012 that currently has 67 member councils with a number of others in the process of joining.
[4408.36s -> 4414.36s]  And the current environment is probably just, you know, even for the councils that don't have any debt.
[4414.36s -> 4424.36s]  They realize that, you know, having access to finances importance, it's sort of probably speeding up, you know, their their time table for joining.
[4424.36s -> 4429.36s]  LGFA is based on similar models in the Scandinavian countries.
[4429.36s -> 4434.36s]  The longest of those is in Denmark that's been going for 130 years now.
[4434.36s -> 4443.36s]  So what LGFA wants is to be a very long term provider of financing to the local authority sector.
[4443.36s -> 4453.36s]  The objectives are interest savings on councils debt to provide a range of borrowing options, so short term and longer term financing.
[4453.36s -> 4458.36s]  And probably the most important one is access to deck markets.
[4458.36s -> 4465.36s]  And that's been the area that's perhaps been the most challenging thing over the past couple of months.
[4465.36s -> 4478.36s]  In terms of the financials, the profit for the year to join 2020, which was forecast to be 10 million is on track.
[4478.36s -> 4488.36s]  So we've been running the part numbers for April, yesterday, and again, the monthly profit is on track.
[4488.36s -> 4496.36s]  A lot of the forecasting that's in the draft SOI is just out of date. It's just been superseded by the events that we've seen the last few months.
[4496.36s -> 4503.36s]  But that said, just remember that LGFA has 10 billion dollars of lending to the sector.
[4503.36s -> 4508.36s]  So we borrow from investors and on land at every time we do, we take a small margin.
[4509.36s -> 4516.36s]  So the profit really on all that lending is locked in until those loans mature.
[4516.36s -> 4527.36s]  So even though they may well be some variability in profit, a lot of it is locked in.
[4527.36s -> 4532.36s]  And that said, the profitability probably shouldn't be your primary concern.
[4532.36s -> 4541.36s]  It is where councils get the savings is the savings on their interest costs and certainty around accessing of finance.
[4541.36s -> 4545.36s]  So that's probably the key thing.
[4545.36s -> 4554.36s]  The current environment interest rates low. So maybe that's one little bit of good use for councils.
[4554.36s -> 4561.36s]  The interest rates, councils like yourself can borrow below 1% now.
[4561.36s -> 4571.36s]  Long term, we just completed a $1 billion debt issue just over a week ago.
[4571.36s -> 4576.36s]  So we borrowed for six years and we borrowed at 1.46% for a billion dollars.
[4576.36s -> 4583.36s]  So we will add on 20 points to councils or 25 points to wipe our offenders.
[4583.36s -> 4592.36s]  So you'd be accessing longer term money, six year money at around 1.7% just to give you some idea of a borrowing cost.
[4592.36s -> 4598.36s]  So that's one bit of good news.
[4598.36s -> 4604.36s]  Probably two or three weeks ago, we were receiving record borrowing requests from councils.
[4604.36s -> 4613.36s]  There was a lot of councils knowing that maybe, you know, fee income is dropping and they needed to get more money into to cover that.
[4613.36s -> 4620.36s]  So we've never had a much, we've had a higher amount of borrowing costs.
[4620.36s -> 4626.36s]  So that was the first non-government entity.
[4626.36s -> 4636.36s]  Well, entity other than the government to issue in New Zealand since the level 4 lockdown was imposed.
[4636.36s -> 4639.36s]  For a while, investors were very reluctant to invest.
[4639.36s -> 4645.36s]  It's just, you know, they're worried even if we buy it, we won't be able to sell things.
[4645.36s -> 4649.36s]  But we had a risk of version that we had two developments.
[4649.36s -> 4659.36s]  One was LGFA have a $1 billion standby facility from the New Zealand government that expires next year.
[4659.36s -> 4669.36s]  But the Minister of Finance provided a letter to LGFA saying that the government would roll that over for a further period of time.
[4669.36s -> 4693.36s]  So the second thing that occurred is that the Reserve Bank announced that they were going to buy back government bonds, a subsequent to that they added LGFA to the listed securities that they're able to buy.
[4693.36s -> 4700.36s]  They're able to buy back up to $3 billion of LGFA bonds from investors.
[4700.36s -> 4709.36s]  And it was that that really gave the confidence to investors that if we buy them, there's actually going to be another huge buyer in the market for that.
[4709.36s -> 4719.36s]  So again, you know, the level of support that we're getting from the government has been extremely important.
[4719.36s -> 4729.36s]  There's going to be significant challenges for councils, particularly in the 2021 sort of financial year.
[4729.36s -> 4738.36s]  Part of the working group that DIA are running, looking at doing a lot of modeling on council financial performance.
[4738.36s -> 4749.36s]  This, well, for the remainder of this year and next year and that's feeding into a lot of the other governments of the workstream, such as the recovery sort of workstream.
[4749.36s -> 4760.36s]  So there's some quite sobering reading coming out of that for why you're probably well positioned in terms of your debt levels.
[4760.36s -> 4769.36s]  You're not high relative to some of the other higher growth councils in New Zealand.
[4769.36s -> 4783.36s]  So yeah, there are a lot of challenges and that's probably one of the challenges for us is that potentially we're going to get breaches of the financial governance in the next financial year, not this financial year.
[4783.36s -> 4800.36s]  That would never had a breach of any of the financial governance, but if revenue falls significantly for councils with a large amount of debt to start with, then they could well breach that net debt to revenue governance.
[4800.36s -> 4803.36s]  So that's something we'll have to deal with.
[4803.36s -> 4822.36s]  But for those growth councils, you know, one of the last tools they've really got is, you know, having to cut their caps and again, that's not particularly conducive to starting growth in the economy and is working against a little bit of what the government wants to achieve.
[4822.36s -> 4833.36s]  So I just like to, you know, we appreciate that there's no compulsion for councils to use LGFA, you're still free to borrow from any other sources that you want.
[4833.36s -> 4850.36s]  So I just like to acknowledge our Ken and this team because why part was one of the yearly supporters of LGFA, we very much value your support of us and, you know, the professional relationship that we have.
[4850.36s -> 4879.36s]  I think you almost goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway LGFA is another great contributor to the local government, seeing generally and certainly, I guess why part hasn't used your services that greatly we certainly intend to in the future, possibly even more with COVID possibly not we don't know yet.
[4880.36s -> 4896.36s]  Yeah, that's true, we don't know, but yeah, but very confident by that one point seven percent number major, that's, yeah, that is, that is very well priced borrowing ability.
[4897.36s -> 4904.36s]  I like the one that was below one percent even better, but yeah, short to possibly isn't us that much.
[4904.36s -> 4909.36s]  No, thanks Andrew, does anyone else have any questions.
[4909.36s -> 4913.36s]  Bruce, and then clear.
[4913.36s -> 4918.36s]  You're still muted Bruce.
[4918.36s -> 4922.36s]  Press the space bar.
[4922.36s -> 4925.36s]  There we go.
[4925.36s -> 4928.36s]  You need to keep pressing it, mate.
[4928.36s -> 4934.36s]  Okay, I'm learning, I've changed machines one doesn't work so once in the bin soon.
[4934.36s -> 4943.36s]  And we just don't pay 33 share capital. I know wife has got 200,000 shares at that point four percent, just a simple one.
[4943.36s -> 4947.36s]  More district have got double ours, but a 9.9 of a percent.
[4947.36s -> 4951.36s]  Did you explain that.
[4951.36s -> 4963.36s]  Yes, the share holding is just something sort of historical so when LGFA was started at needed 25 million of equity.
[4963.36s -> 4970.36s]  So there was, I think, 9 or 10 councils that were the initial subscribers and then they.
[4970.36s -> 4978.36s]  Ensold some of the issues to a second group of councils that came in as shareholders.
[4978.36s -> 4986.36s]  So LGFA pay a small dividend to councils on their shareholder.
[4986.36s -> 4993.36s]  That is 2% over cost of funds, but our cost of funds might only be like 1.5% at the moment.
[4993.36s -> 5001.36s]  So on 100,000 dollars of shares, you're only going to be getting right the three or 4,000 dollar dividend.
[5001.36s -> 5005.36s]  So that is really not material.
[5005.36s -> 5009.36s]  So the level of equity you have is really not that important.
[5009.36s -> 5021.36s]  It is the savings that you get on your borrowing costs that are going to be the big, you know, drivers of why, you know, council should be members of LGFA.
[5021.36s -> 5028.36s]  So it really doesn't give you a lot of advantage over, you know, a council that is a non shareholder.
[5028.36s -> 5032.36s]  Again, they're still getting the same borrowing benefits that you are.
[5032.36s -> 5039.36s]  It's just simply a fact we needed some councils to put in some equity to get the thing off of the ground.
[5039.36s -> 5043.36s]  So again, you know, we're grateful for the councils that did that.
[5043.36s -> 5052.36s]  I think you're interested in doubling the figure and then being in ordinary terms and thinking, well, how did you get to that? So no, thank you.
[5052.36s -> 5055.36s]  So just work it out for your Bruce.
[5055.36s -> 5057.36s]  It's a rounding thing.
[5057.36s -> 5061.36s]  It's actually we've actually got 0.444 of a percent.
[5061.36s -> 5065.36s]  And when you double that, you get 0.888.
[5065.36s -> 5068.36s]  So it's just rounding up and down.
[5068.36s -> 5069.36s]  Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[5069.36s -> 5070.36s]  Yeah, so knowledgeable.
[5070.36s -> 5072.36s]  Oh, clear.
[5072.36s -> 5073.36s]  Yeah, thanks.
[5073.36s -> 5081.36s]  The question I had is about LGFA saying one of the principles is that they'll demonstrate social environment,
[5081.36s -> 5083.36s]  environmental responsibility.
[5083.36s -> 5092.36s]  And one question that I've been asking in past is, will LGFA consider introducing something like green financing or environmental bonds?
[5092.36s -> 5099.36s]  You know, like the productivity commission did a report to a low emissions economy, you know, a couple of years ago.
[5099.36s -> 5109.36s]  The highlight of it, actually, there's a bit of a gap in New Zealand with this kind of financing where councils could borrow for a project that would be, you know,
[5109.36s -> 5113.36s]  reducing emissions or for environmental outcomes.
[5113.36s -> 5118.36s]  And usually it's sort of a slight margin lease or something, just to say it's a good thing to be doing.
[5118.36s -> 5121.36s]  And we want to encourage councils.
[5121.36s -> 5123.36s]  Do you think LGFA would do that?
[5123.36s -> 5126.36s]  Or are you talking to government about that?
[5126.36s -> 5128.36s]  Thank you for that question.
[5128.36s -> 5137.36s]  It is the whole environmental issues have been pushed a little bit to the back of the environment because of everything that's going on.
[5137.36s -> 5148.36s]  But LGFA has done a significant amount of work on that and we are intending to offer green financing to councils.
[5148.36s -> 5154.36s]  So remembering that it's not LGFA that is doing things with the money.
[5154.36s -> 5158.36s]  We're just on lending us the resources in the middle.
[5158.36s -> 5164.36s]  We've actually got all the documents up and ready to go.
[5164.36s -> 5170.36s]  The issue is we're going to need councils to identify green projects.
[5170.36s -> 5172.36s]  And also there's three categories.
[5172.36s -> 5175.36s]  So there's green, social and sustainable.
[5175.36s -> 5179.36s]  So for example, a lot of the water things actually come under sustainable.
[5179.36s -> 5185.36s]  So there's a whole industry around it and it involves identifying things.
[5185.36s -> 5189.36s]  And also there's a certification process involved on that.
[5189.36s -> 5194.36s]  So I could probably speak to you for a day on this topic because it is.
[5194.36s -> 5201.36s]  If you see the documents, they, you know, it must be like a hundred pages long and we've got all that really to go.
[5201.36s -> 5205.36s]  So it is all happening, but it will be, it's not going to be compulsory.
[5205.36s -> 5210.36s]  It will be up to each council is to how they use that.
[5210.36s -> 5220.36s]  And investing is a big thing globally, particularly in Europe, probably less so in the US.
[5220.36s -> 5227.36s]  But certainly it does give you better access to debt markets if you can.
[5227.36s -> 5230.36s]  Well, I'm thrilled to hear that you're working on it.
[5230.36s -> 5236.36s]  I actually think you should report on it so that you're actually preparing or, you know, working on a proposal.
[5236.36s -> 5241.36s]  I think a lot of people would be looking for that and just say, well, congratulations.
[5241.36s -> 5247.36s]  I think it's great that you've made here some, I suppose, some groundwork progress.
[5247.36s -> 5251.36s]  And yeah, look forward to seeing when you can actually make an announcement.
[5251.36s -> 5256.36s]  Yeah, we did, we have a council day each year, sort of in July.
[5256.36s -> 5259.36s]  And we did flag that it was something we intend to do.
[5259.36s -> 5262.36s]  So we would, you know, give the update again this year.
[5262.36s -> 5265.36s]  But it is something that's definitely happening.
[5265.36s -> 5274.36s]  And we're more than happy to come and speak to you if you want to have, you know, more in-depth discussion about that side of the business.
[5274.36s -> 5276.36s]  Thank you.
[5276.36s -> 5278.36s]  Thanks.
[5278.36s -> 5282.36s]  Any other questions for Andrew?
[5282.36s -> 5288.36s]  No, okay, that being the case, thank you very much for assuming with us.
[5288.36s -> 5289.36s]  Yeah.
[5289.36s -> 5290.36s]  Always good.
[5290.36s -> 5292.36s]  I might see you in place one of these days.
[5292.36s -> 5293.36s]  Yeah, no, please.
[5293.36s -> 5295.36s]  Okay. Thanks very much.
[5295.36s -> 5296.36s]  Yes.
[5296.36s -> 5297.36s]  Okay.
[5297.36s -> 5298.36s]  Well, thanks for that.
[5298.36s -> 5299.36s]  Everybody.
[5299.36s -> 5303.36s]  We have a recommendation that runs from A to G.
[5303.36s -> 5306.36s]  I'm not even going to attempt to read them all out.
[5306.36s -> 5308.36s]  I'm sure you can.
[5308.36s -> 5309.36s]  Yeah.
[5309.36s -> 5310.36s]  Sorry, Andrew.
[5310.36s -> 5316.36s]  Probably the thing we just need to turn our attention to, because obviously a key part of that.
[5316.36s -> 5326.36s]  And that series of recommendations is the three leaders that are in the appendices of appendix, appendix four, five and six.
[5326.36s -> 5331.36s]  So I do just wonder with her just before you before you put the recommendation.
[5331.36s -> 5337.36s]  We for it is just with just seeking any any input into those, those three leaders.
[5337.36s -> 5345.36s]  Because obviously when we, when you actually do put the recommendation, you will be essentially locking in those leaders.
[5345.36s -> 5346.36s]  Yeah.
[5346.36s -> 5347.36s]  Thanks for that.
[5347.36s -> 5348.36s]  Ken, you're, you're very right.
[5348.36s -> 5349.36s]  I did think of that.
[5349.36s -> 5354.36s]  I read through them and I, I felt they've seemed pretty appropriate.
[5354.36s -> 5355.36s]  As they are.
[5355.36s -> 5360.36s]  Because, particularly with.
[5360.36s -> 5363.36s]  Oh, cast my mind back now, particularly with the airport.
[5363.36s -> 5367.36s]  We acknowledge that there was going to be a major revision in there.
[5367.36s -> 5368.36s]  So I.
[5368.36s -> 5370.36s]  But yeah, is there anyone.
[5370.36s -> 5372.36s]  Does anyone have any.
[5372.36s -> 5374.36s]  Any thoughts on a note?
[5374.36s -> 5375.36s]  All good.
[5375.36s -> 5376.36s]  Thanks for that.
[5376.36s -> 5378.36s]  Ken, but I think we're all good.
[5378.36s -> 5383.36s]  So could I have a mover, please.
[5383.36s -> 5384.36s]  Thank you, Bruce.
[5384.36s -> 5386.36s]  And the seconder.
[5386.36s -> 5387.36s]  Thanks, Lou.
[5387.36s -> 5388.36s]  Cheers.
[5388.36s -> 5390.36s]  All in favor.
[5390.36s -> 5392.36s]  All right.
[5392.36s -> 5393.36s]  Country.
[5393.36s -> 5395.36s]  No, it's carried.
[5395.36s -> 5396.36s]  Okay.
[5396.36s -> 5400.36s]  Moving on to item number nine.
[5400.36s -> 5402.36s]  And I see Nardis there.
[5402.36s -> 5405.36s]  Ken, did you want to introduce or.
[5405.36s -> 5406.36s]  No luck I'm.
[5406.36s -> 5411.36s]  I'm very happy to leave this to, to Nardis, to take us through the financial report.
[5411.36s -> 5416.36s]  Um, yeah, I, I, I guess the only thing I'm off significance and, again,
[5416.36s -> 5417.36s]  there is a health warning there.
[5417.36s -> 5419.36s]  A little bit like I come like the form up.
[5419.36s -> 5422.36s]  The report that you saw at the last council meeting.
[5422.36s -> 5426.36s]  Obviously anything in that, um, in that forecast column.
[5426.36s -> 5429.36s]  Is, um, yeah, is, is obviously outdated by the, um,
[5429.36s -> 5435.92s]  by the COVID events so yeah so yeah a huge effort has gone on right across some cross counts
[5435.92s -> 5441.20s]  on the last in the last two or three weeks to yeah to re-forecast and you should see
[5441.20s -> 5445.52s]  the results of that re-forecast and you should have a obviously quite a different
[5446.24s -> 5451.36s]  forecast column in the NICS funding to report you see but yeah but look let's see down
[5451.36s -> 5459.12s]  a happy phone now to take us through the report. Thanks very much. Thanks Ken. Good afternoon
[5459.12s -> 5466.64s]  everyone. So at the currently standing at the end of March the total income is currently
[5466.64s -> 5475.76s]  at 74% of the forecast and the operating expenditure is at 72% of the four-year forecast.
[5476.48s -> 5486.88s]  We have vested assets of 11.8 million recognised to date and that's currently 94% of the
[5486.88s -> 5497.04s]  four-cast. Discovered assets is 402,000. Development and reserve contributions
[5499.04s -> 5507.28s]  of 4.4 million have been received to date and subsidies and grants are at 47% of the
[5507.28s -> 5517.76s]  forecast. We have capital expenditure to date of 71.3 million which is 51% of the forecast
[5519.76s -> 5527.60s]  and there have been no major budget changes this month due to re-forecasting happening now.
[5529.28s -> 5535.92s]  There was one arbitrage arrangement made on the 12th of March that utilised six million
[5535.92s -> 5543.84s]  dollars of short-term fixed borrowings and it was on March terms mature and in June and we'll
[5543.84s -> 5557.20s]  yield approximately 13,000 of net interest. The rates we have the 62.1 million that's been set for
[5557.20s -> 5570.40s]  the year. Prior years outstanding at this time was 62,000 and we have currently 464,000 outstanding
[5570.40s -> 5579.68s]  at the year to date. And then I'll take the rest of the report as being read and if anyone's
[5579.68s -> 5589.44s]  got any questions. Okay, any questions? Not a big change really to the
[5590.08s -> 5595.44s]  what we have presented at the Clientel meeting so yeah, we're pretty much. Thanks for that
[5595.44s -> 5601.28s]  Nada, that's great and there being no questions I will ask for a move for the recommendation.
[5601.68s -> 5612.72s]  Thank you Roger and a seconder. Thanks Client. Thanks Client. I'll catch you next time for it. All in favour.
[5615.44s -> 5624.48s]  High country no, it's carried. Thank you very much and thanks Nada and I'll move on to item 10.
[5624.88s -> 5627.68s]  Health and safety.
[5631.68s -> 5636.64s]  Yeah, look I think I'm actually a stiff, yes, stiff is still there. So yeah, this is absolutely
[5636.64s -> 5642.08s]  young, stiff shores baby and in fact beavers beavers well who has joined us. So yeah, we had no
[5642.08s -> 5649.60s]  to stiffen beavers. Great, welcome, stiffen beavers. Hi guys. Another good new story. We need some of them.
[5654.72s -> 5673.76s]  Step to want to start off. Oh, yeah, yeah, all yours. All mine. Okay, so I take it that you guys have
[5673.76s -> 5685.92s]  have read the report and the attachments to this. I do see that there are a couple of questions from
[5685.92s -> 5692.32s]  clear. But is there anything else that you guys would like to ask before I get to those questions
[5692.32s -> 5701.84s]  from clear? It looks like the floor is yours clear. Yeah, a couple of questions.
[5703.68s -> 5710.16s]  Yeah, well, I mean, the first one was that there were four, the council entranceways with the
[5710.16s -> 5716.72s]  the location of a number of accidents. So, if you looked into those entranceways, is there
[5716.72s -> 5728.24s]  something to do with the entranceways? Like, yeah, beavers. Yeah, there were just the two trips
[5728.24s -> 5736.40s]  in entranceways. And we did get property to have a look. And there wasn't anything of significance
[5736.40s -> 5750.24s]  that we found. Can you guys hear me now? Yeah, so we didn't find anything of significance
[5751.20s -> 5756.08s]  of why they tripped. The only thing we, it was sort of at the lip where the doors
[5758.64s -> 5763.12s]  kind of closed. And this is at Cambridge. So I did property did have a look at those.
[5764.08s -> 5769.76s]  But we couldn't find anything that would have caused those trips. And we haven't had any
[5769.76s -> 5775.28s]  reported since. So it may mean just one of those things. But we are continuing to monitor anyway.
[5776.08s -> 5785.60s]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, it would just be our luck that, you know, our facilities are causing a
[5785.68s -> 5790.40s]  problem for people that are coming into this. Yeah, yeah. So I just thought it'd be good to know
[5790.40s -> 5799.36s]  a bit more about that. Yeah. Okay. Can you hear me? Yes, yes. Wonderful. I'm so sorry, I lost my
[5799.36s -> 5805.52s]  my voice there for a minute. So I clear, I understood you had another question as well. And
[5805.52s -> 5811.52s]  that was regarding what ways we have to keep track of how, how to say, do resources and processes
[5811.52s -> 5818.72s]  have been utilized? Yeah. That's a really good question. Perhaps if I, if you go to the A3 or the
[5818.72s -> 5826.80s]  big report on a page, above the Health and Safety Due diligence plan monitoring, above that is
[5826.80s -> 5833.44s]  the Health and Safety lead indicators. Now these lead indicators are basically the resources
[5834.00s -> 5841.36s]  and the contractors that we use. And so essentially what we pay for. And that's how we monitor
[5841.76s -> 5846.96s]  and provide to you the details in what we're spending our Health and Safety budget on.
[5846.96s -> 5852.80s]  We do have a very small Health and Safety budget obviously. But what does Health and Safety
[5852.80s -> 5859.68s]  lead indicators show to you is that we, we pay an ongoing fee to the Waikato Occupational
[5859.68s -> 5867.04s]  Health Consultancy who deliver our Health Monitoring Services. We also provide money to the EAP
[5867.28s -> 5875.52s]  service which is, so provides, I guess, counselling services to all of our staff. We also have
[5875.52s -> 5881.92s]  training, Health and Safety training. So we have set aside 27,000 for Health and Safety training
[5881.92s -> 5889.36s]  in the manual year. And that's that obviously is first aid refreshes and a Health and Safety
[5889.36s -> 5895.92s]  Committee training as well as any investigation training which we are looking at at the moment.
[5895.92s -> 5900.80s]  And our regular conflict training which obviously comes out of that budget as well.
[5901.44s -> 5906.88s]  And these are all reported through these reporting mechanisms to yourselves and also to the
[5906.88s -> 5912.80s]  executive team. So I guess that's one of our due diligence and how we show that we are
[5912.80s -> 5916.80s]  utilising external resources and finances appropriately.
[5918.16s -> 5924.48s]  Oh no, that's a great explanation and I can see how it all fits together. I guess I was
[5924.48s -> 5932.08s]  wondering about how you knew if just individual staff members were actually, you know, knowledgeable
[5932.08s -> 5937.44s]  about Health and Safety Practices or if they were starting a new task or something that they
[5938.48s -> 5944.08s]  did actually get the right briefing and the stuff like that. Like, are you confident that that
[5944.08s -> 5950.32s]  kind of sort of more grassroots of those processes are working well as well?
[5951.28s -> 5956.72s]  I think we feel free to jump in here but I'm actually very confident because we have some
[5957.92s -> 5965.36s]  very good well-educated Health and Safety representatives now and I must say they are
[5966.24s -> 5972.32s]  committed, they attend the meetings, they go back to their respective teams and they disseminate
[5972.40s -> 5979.52s]  that information. You know, we're making sure that any training is out there, I've got Bev and
[5980.64s -> 5987.44s]  Terry now working with all staff and specially team leaders and supervisors about how to keep
[5987.44s -> 5996.88s]  this task safe. I know that's great, thank you. Yes, thank you. Can you hear me all right?
[5996.96s -> 6003.20s]  I can. No, it doesn't seem to be coming through my headphones. I think this is a great report
[6004.48s -> 6014.08s]  but the question I have is, is there any way that we can assess some of the external influences
[6014.08s -> 6023.12s]  on our team's health and safety from COVID-19? Yes, absolutely. In the game, Bev, feel free to
[6023.12s -> 6030.64s]  jump in here. This report only covers the period from November through to February, so critically
[6030.64s -> 6037.04s]  it misses, essentially misses all the COVID-19 that will come in the next report. But yes,
[6037.04s -> 6045.04s]  absolutely, we have a staff monitor or staff register which we monitor the health and well-being
[6045.12s -> 6056.40s]  of all our staff, any that have immunocompromised health issues. We are aware of where our staff are,
[6056.40s -> 6064.24s]  what they're doing and with our slightly moving to level three, next week we've gone out to all
[6064.24s -> 6069.84s]  managers to advise us of where exactly their staff are going to be working, whether they will
[6069.92s -> 6076.32s]  be continuing to work from home, whether we will have some like our parks operators working
[6076.32s -> 6082.00s]  back out in the community and from a health and safety perspective, we're working up some really
[6082.00s -> 6089.36s]  good protocols around how to keep them all safe. So I hope that answered your question to Council
[6089.36s -> 6095.84s]  Gordon? Yeah, I was more wondering about whether any of the external influences over which we've
[6096.00s -> 6100.64s]  got no control, you know, that they're actually finding in their own family circumstances and
[6100.64s -> 6107.84s]  something like that that's actually affecting their mental state, which obviously is a health and
[6107.84s -> 6116.48s]  stiff issue. I can come in here if you like, Steve. I've just come out of a webinar with EMA
[6117.52s -> 6123.44s]  in which one of New Zealand's leading people on health and safety poor Javi was part of, so that
[6123.44s -> 6132.00s]  actually ruled out quite a few ways on how this can be managed in multiple levels, and I know
[6132.00s -> 6138.16s]  that our Y-PAR team have been working along those same lines. So you know, this is all pretty
[6138.16s -> 6145.12s]  new to everybody, so we're still writing up those protocols and hopefully getting everything in
[6145.12s -> 6152.64s]  place prior to actually going out next week on level three. Oh good, great to see those, thanks.
[6153.84s -> 6164.00s]  Great, everybody else. No, I'd just like to say it's great to see your health and safety
[6164.00s -> 6173.76s]  program maturing each report that we get, and I just wanted to say, I think your one page
[6173.76s -> 6181.84s]  carries health and safety commitment. That's a really, really good thing to put in place.
[6182.64s -> 6188.08s]  There's nothing like everybody in the organisation seeing that the CEO is committed
[6188.08s -> 6191.76s]  to the program, so congratulations on that.
[6194.96s -> 6202.08s]  Cheers, well done. Okay, so I have a recommendation to accept the report. Do I have a move, please?
[6203.36s -> 6209.68s]  Thank you, Claire. Thank you, Ellen. All those in favour, please say aye.
[6210.56s -> 6211.36s]  Aye. Aye.
[6211.36s -> 6215.76s]  Country no, that's carried. Thanks, ladies. That's terrific.
[6216.32s -> 6221.60s]  Welcome Phil, we're just going to pass a motion to move into public, excluded,
[6222.40s -> 6229.76s]  and then go off live. Oh, thanks, Roger. In a seconder, thanks, Susan. All in favour, aye.
[6231.84s -> 6235.92s]  Country no, that's carried. So Sam, will you do your thing?
